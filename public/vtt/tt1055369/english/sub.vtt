- C-Can you just stop?

183
00:13:16.264 --> 00:13:17.663
- Yeah, okay, I'll stop.
- Just wait...

I don't wanna go
anywhere with you.

- Alright, fine.
- I'm just going back inside.

190

- Hi.

- Become a waffle iron.

Just consider this the official start
of a remodel, okay?

223
00:15:38.683 --> 00:15:40.713
Fine. If the government's paying,
I want a pool...

224
00:15:40.793 --> 00:15:41.964
- and a hot tub.
- Fine. Okay.

225

I wanna wait outside,
okay?

233
00:16:08.072 --> 00:16:09.492
I wanted to tell you
about this earlier.

234
00:16:09.527 --> 00:16:11.002
It's just that...
You know,

235
00:16:11.037 --> 00:16:12.033
Here's the thing.

236
00:16:12.134 --> 00:16:13.653
Freshmen aren't allowed
to have cars.

237
00:16:14.181 --> 00:16:17.143
I know, and if it was up to me,
I'd take you with me, but it's not, Bee.

238
00:16:17.308 --> 00:16:18.579
Look, you're an Autobot.

239
00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:20.235
You shouldn't be living
in my dad's garage.

240
00:16:20.258 --> 00:16:21.819
I mean,
you're suffocating in here.

241
00:16:22.205 --> 00:16:23.625
You deserve
better than this.

242
00:16:24.389 --> 00:16:25.641
This is hard enough, man,

243
00:16:25.642 --> 00:16:27.468
don't make it harder.
Can you just look at me, please?

244
00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:31.079
Come on, big guy.

245
00:16:31.713 --> 00:16:34.852
Look, the guardian thing is done, okay?
You did your job.

246
00:16:34.954 --> 00:16:36.261
Look, I'm safe now.

247

Optimus Prime and the others.

to be normal, Bee.

That's why
I'm going to college.

250
00:16:42.433 --> 00:16:43.827
I can't do that
with you.

251
00:16:45.589 --> 00:16:47.678
It's not the last time
I'm gonna see you, you know, Bee.

252
00:16:47.824 --> 00:16:50.873
Come on, don't do that. Bee.
You're killing me, Bee.

253
00:16:53.115 --> 00:16:54.579
But you'll always be
my first car.

254
00:16:57.466 --> 00:16:58.992

- It's...I'm okay.

Well, look.

00:17:14.379 --> 00:17:15.564

you can make it

262
00:17:17.393 --> 00:17:19.132
You're like the best thing
that ever happened to me.

00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:21.096
And?

264
00:17:21.097 --> 00:17:24.602
- And I'll do anything for you.
- And?

265
00:17:24.681 --> 00:17:27.526
- I think Sam's about to say the L word.
- Let's go, kiddo.

266
00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:29.252
Nice timing, Dad.

267
00:17:29.253 --> 00:17:31.363
I... adore you.

268
00:17:32.565 --> 00:17:34.476
That's not the word that
I wanna hear really now.

269
00:17:34.511 --> 00:17:36.158
What are you talking about?
It's the same word as the other word.

270
00:17:36.159 --> 00:17:38.172
- It's not the same word.
- Look, if I said the other word now,

271
00:17:38.208 --> 00:17:39.583
you forced me to say
won't mean anything.

272
00:17:39.618 --> 00:17:40.591
Plus, you haven't
said it either.

273
00:17:40.592 --> 00:17:42.143
So don't get mad at me
for not saying it.

274
00:17:42.162 --> 00:17:42.863
Yeah,
but I haven't said it

275
00:17:42.864 --> 00:17:44.634
because guys always run
when you say it first.

276
00:17:44.669 --> 00:17:45.723
Yeah, well,
so do girls.

277
00:17:45.724 --> 00:17:47.465
Especially,
girls like you with options.

278
00:17:48.506 --> 00:17:51.551
So this is all part
of your elaborate plan

279
00:17:51.586 --> 00:17:53.219

280
00:17:53.326 --> 00:17:54.767
Can be.

00:22:39.721 --> 00:22:43.342
We've witnessed
your human capacity for war.

345
00:22:43.594 --> 00:22:47.207
It would absolutely
bring more harm than good.

346
00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:50.294
But who are you
to judge what's best for us?

347
00:22:50.295 --> 00:22:52.456
With all due respect,
we've been fighting side-by-side

348
00:22:52.491 --> 00:22:53.989
in the field
for two years.

349
00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:57.154
We've shared blood, sweat
and precious metal together.

350
00:22:57.521 --> 00:23:00.213
Soldier, you're paid to shoot;
not talk.

351
00:23:00.248 --> 00:23:01.872
Don't tell me.

352
00:23:01.873 --> 00:23:03.194
And the, uh...

353
00:23:03.284 --> 00:23:05.256
- The newest members of your team...
- Easy...

354
00:23:05.588 --> 00:23:08.945
I understand they arrived here
after you sent a message into space.

355
00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:10.965
An open invitation
to come to Earth,

356
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.664
<i>embedded by no one
at the White House.</i>

357
00:23:12.704 --> 00:23:14.830
Let me stop you
right there, Mr. Galloway.

358
00:23:14.865 --> 00:23:16.384
It was bedded
right here.

359
00:23:16.445 --> 00:23:20.436
<i>And in my experience, the judgement
of both Major Lennox and his team,</i>

360
00:23:20.471 --> 00:23:23.506
has always been
above reproach.

361
00:23:23.507 --> 00:23:26.346
<i>Well be that as it may, General,
it is the position of the President</i>

362
00:23:26.381 --> 00:23:28.422
<i>that when our national security
is at stake,</i>

363
00:23:29.559 --> 00:23:32.038
<i>no one
is above reproach.</i>

364
00:23:32.672 --> 00:23:35.223
Now, what do
we know so far?

365
00:23:35.867 --> 00:23:37.827
We know
that the enemy leader,

366
00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:41.623
<i>classified NBE-1,
AKA Megatron,</i>

367
00:23:42.014 --> 00:23:43.334
<i>is resting in peace</i>

368
00:23:43.369 --> 00:23:45.371
<i>at the bottom
of the Laurentian Abyss,</i>

369
00:23:45.406 --> 00:23:47.583
<i>surrounded by
societs detection nets</i>

370
00:23:47.623 --> 00:23:49.994
<i>and a full-time
submarine surveillance.</i>

371
00:23:50.065 --> 00:23:51.212
We also know that

372
00:23:51.213 --> 00:23:54.434
<i>the only remaining piece
of your alien All-Spark</i>

373
00:23:54.469 --> 00:23:56.509
<i>is locked in
an electromagnetic vault,</i>

374
00:23:56.544 --> 00:24:00.088
<i>here on one of the most secure
naval bases in the world.</i>

375
00:24:01.162 --> 00:24:04.593
Decepticons,
we have located the shard.

376
00:24:04.628 --> 00:24:06.028
<i>And since no one...</i>

377
00:24:06.299 --> 00:24:10.277
can seem to tell me
what the enemy is now after,

378
00:24:10.608 --> 00:24:13.471
well, there...there's only
one clear conclusion:

379
00:24:13.472 --> 00:24:16.719
You.
The Autobots.

380
00:24:17.071 --> 00:24:19.648
They're here to hunt you.

381
00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:22.609
What's there to hunt for
on Earth besides that?

382
00:24:22.644 --> 00:24:25.260
"The Fallen...
shall rise again"?

383
00:24:25.503 --> 00:24:27.078
Sounds to me like
something's coming.

384
00:24:27.865 --> 00:24:30.831
So let me ask
if we ultimately conclude

385
00:24:30.881 --> 00:24:32.717
that our national security
is best served

386
00:24:32.758 --> 00:24:36.669
by denying you further asylum
on our planet,

387
00:24:38.236 --> 00:24:41.232
will you leave peacefully?

388
00:24:41.539 --> 00:24:43.040
Freedom is your right.

389
00:24:43.412 --> 00:24:46.252
If you make that request,
we will honor it.

390
00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:52.735
But before your president decides,
please ask him this.

391
00:24:53.119 --> 00:24:57.728
What if we leave
and you're wrong?

392
00:25:05.291 --> 00:25:06.916
That's a good question.

393
00:25:10.181 --> 00:25:11.502
Oh, my God,

394
00:25:11.537 --> 00:25:13.841
just look at this place!

395
00:25:14.675 --> 00:25:17.183
I feel smarter already.

396
00:25:17.716 --> 00:25:19.371
Ron, can you smell it?

397
00:25:19.834 --> 00:25:21.963
Yes, smells
like $40,000 a year.

398
00:25:22.022 --> 00:25:23.674
Okay, cheapo.

399
00:25:24.376 --> 00:25:26.559
Go ahead, we'll, uh...
We'll get your stuff.

400
00:25:26.594 --> 00:25:27.934
Just go ahead
and check out your room.

00:25:36.579 --> 00:25:38.042
- Hey.
- Hey.

403
00:25:38.404 --> 00:25:40.076
You must be Sam, right?
I'm Leo.

404
00:25:40.107 --> 00:25:41.277
Hey.

405
00:25:42.443 --> 00:25:44.943
Uh, sorry, I already set up the crib.
Do you want this side or that side?

406
00:25:46.821 --> 00:25:48.560
- That side.
- I already chose that side.

407
00:25:51.123 --> 00:25:53.223
You know what this is?
This is the awkward moment.

408
00:25:53.918 --> 00:25:55.904
Yeah, so you're trying to see
if I'm a normal guy.

409
00:25:55.934 --> 00:25:57.059
I'm trying to see
if you're a normal guy,

410
00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:58.752
balanced and medicated enough
for another coral space.

411

Good personal hygiene
won't stab me in my sleep.

Good criminal record

00:26:01.391 --> 00:26:02.856
- Including girlfriends.
- Especially girlfriends.

414
00:26:02.857 --> 00:26:04.271
- You got a girlfriend?
- I do.

415
00:26:04.272 --> 00:26:07.247
- You?
- No, not a chance.

416
00:26:07.282 --> 00:26:08.721
- You're a techie?
- Hmm.

417
00:26:08.722 --> 00:26:09.622
Sweet.

418
00:26:09.623 --> 00:26:12.137
- Sharsky, Fassbiner, where we at?
- Server's almost online, Leo.

419
00:26:12.172 --> 00:26:13.460
It works up and running.

420
00:26:13.461 --> 00:26:14.808
Beautiful; that's what
I like to hear.

421

That's me,
I'm sure you've heard of it.

425
00:26:22.412 --> 00:26:24.854
- No, I haven't.
- Well, that sucks.

It's where it started.
Look at me now.

Got our dreams, bro.

431
00:26:35.556 --> 00:26:37.338
Leo, we got some
bad news in Shanghai.

432
00:26:37.899 --> 00:26:40.290
Post it, baby. Go, go, go!
FTJ, FTJ!

433
00:26:40.874 --> 00:26:42.370
- It's clean.
- What's FTJ?

434
00:26:42.371 --> 00:26:44.724
- Fuel the Jet, Fuel the Jet.
- FTJ, FTJ.

435
00:26:48.924 --> 00:26:51.030
- This is it. Did you see that?
- Wow. Okay, this half of Shanghai

436
00:26:51.061 --> 00:26:52.499
gets rigged
when China says gas leak.

437
00:26:52.534 --> 00:26:53.836
Don't believe the hype, bro.

438
00:26:54.922 --> 00:26:58.222
Just like the alien robots in LA
two years ago that everyone covered up.

439
00:26:58.695 --> 00:27:00.573
Yeah, I saw these robots
and they did this, like,

440
00:27:00.608 --> 00:27:02.969
firing thing and they came down
and twisted this woman

441
00:27:03.005 --> 00:27:04.330
- and she was like...
- Looks fake to me.

442
00:27:04.349 --> 00:27:07.395
Dude, it's not fake.
The Internet's pure true.

443
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:09.449
- Neither does it lie.
- It looks fake.

444
00:27:09.484 --> 00:27:11.526
No, man, I've seen them.
They are like these, uh, robots...

445
00:27:12.404 --> 00:27:15.238
Look, look, look, it's fake.
Anybody can do on any computer, okay?

446
00:27:15.273 --> 00:27:16.879
And I wasn't, uh... there.

447
00:27:17.312 --> 00:27:18.791
So I can't comment
or speculate.

448
00:27:18.826 --> 00:27:20.754
- Oh, no.
- "Comment and speculate"?

449
00:27:20.789 --> 00:27:22.106
We're supposed
to go habitate?

450
00:27:22.146 --> 00:27:25.120
No, listen, okay.
Don't be sucking the sack, bro.

451
00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:26.849
- Whose sack?
- Look, the ball sack.

452
00:27:26.997 --> 00:27:30.096
- Dude, what kind of tool are you?
- Mainstream media sack.

453
00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:31.482
They're lying to us,
alright.

454
00:27:31.523 --> 00:27:33.636
- It's aliens, man.
- Okay, okay.

455
00:27:33.987 --> 00:27:35.305
Follow me.

456
00:27:35.306 --> 00:27:38.505
Uh-oh. Uh, Leo.
Bad news, we just got scooped.

457
00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:39.916
The video's already up
on GeoBoard.

458
00:27:39.955 --> 00:27:42.364
Damn...
No!

our conspiracy step.

460
00:27:44.963 --> 00:27:46.869
Effing was my effing idea.
He stole it.

461
00:27:46.904 --> 00:27:49.407
He's been looking to my site
and thieving hits for ever!

462
00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:50.741
By the way,
I read your file.

463
00:27:50.742 --> 00:27:53.265
I'll pour, you'll pour...
We're gonna fix that, alright?

464
00:27:53.396 --> 00:27:54.935
You work for me, now.

465
00:27:56.465 --> 00:27:57.921
I work for you now?

466
00:27:58.174 --> 00:27:59.619
That's incredible.
It's first day of college,

467
00:27:59.654 --> 00:28:01.686
I got a career,
a dinky internet firm,

468
00:28:01.718 --> 00:28:04.779
with a boss who is made up
of just pure champion stuff.

469
00:28:04.814 --> 00:28:06.821
You're mocking
my life's work, Samuel? Huh?

470
00:28:06.902 --> 00:28:08.282
That's your one warning
patrolling, dude.

471
00:28:08.312 --> 00:28:10.328
Don't make me that fast....
'cause I'll do it.

472
00:28:10.363 --> 00:28:12.769
Hey alright, listen. It's getting
a little intense in my room.

473
00:28:12.804 --> 00:28:14.898
- Can I switch now?
- Oh, sad face, 3-12.

474
00:28:14.938 --> 00:28:17.773
No switching, no treating.
Let's turn that upside-down, okay?

475
00:28:18.151 --> 00:28:19.540
- Oh, here we go.
- Hey, hi.

476
00:28:19.575 --> 00:28:21.653
It's just like Hogwarts.
Hi!

477
00:28:21.688 --> 00:28:23.484
Is this co-ed?
This is a co-ed dorm.

478
00:28:23.519 --> 00:28:24.974
Do you guys want
to meet my roommates?

479
00:28:25.009 --> 00:28:26.532
- Yeah.
- 'Cause they're real swell guys.

480
00:28:26.533 --> 00:28:27.669
- Here is Leo.
- We're the Witwicky.

481
00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:29.094
- I'm Leo.
- I'm Judy.

482
00:28:29.134 --> 00:28:30.996
Hey, you have a great son.
You really do.

483
00:28:31.031 --> 00:28:32.488
Oh, well aren't you
the sweetest thing?

484
00:28:32.527 --> 00:28:33.907
He's real sweet, Ma.

485
00:28:33.908 --> 00:28:34.969
What is that in your hand,
by the way?

486
00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:37.678
Oh, I got this at the bake sale
for the environment

487
00:28:37.713 --> 00:28:39.101
that those boys
were having.

488
00:28:39.121 --> 00:28:40.586
You know, you don't often
see white boys

489
00:28:40.621 --> 00:28:41.980
with the dreadlocks.

490
00:28:42.015 --> 00:28:44.192
- Mom.
- Yeah, it's a 100 percent pure Hawaiian

491
00:28:44.222 --> 00:28:46.615
- green for the environment.
- Jud...Can you please drop it?

492
00:28:46.908 --> 00:28:49.032
Yeah, then they baked it
with reefer in it.

493
00:28:49.067 --> 00:28:50.453
- No, it's canna... Hey!
- Please give me.

494
00:28:50.488 --> 00:28:52.407
Hey! It's my cheap day.
I can eat whatever I want.

495
00:28:52.442 --> 00:28:54.500
Please God, I'm gonna freak out.
Please do something right now, Dad.

496
00:28:54.535 --> 00:28:55.404
- Please do something right now.
- Okay, okay.

497
00:28:55.405 --> 00:28:56.947
Out of my way,
you wild hair!

498
00:28:56.948 --> 00:28:58.865
I can eat all the freaking
brownies I want!

499
00:28:58.900 --> 00:28:59.821
Sorry, fellas.

500
00:28:59.822 --> 00:29:01.320
I'm sorry and
you're welcome.

501
00:29:04.532 --> 00:29:06.183
We call it the Hot Freshmen 55.

502
00:29:06.184 --> 00:29:09.206
Sharsky hacked campus house and
stacked the dorm with pretty beddies.

503
00:29:12.693 --> 00:29:14.006
Oh, my God.
It's her.

504
00:29:14.193 --> 00:29:16.026
She's coming.
She sees me, she sees me.

505
00:29:18.541 --> 00:29:19.951
She's tight for me on one
on my to-do list.

506
00:29:19.986 --> 00:29:21.680
Do not bird-dog
my credit, you hear me?

507
00:29:22.123 --> 00:29:23.428
Pretty girls.

508
00:29:23.429 --> 00:29:26.253

679
00:42:32.924 --> 00:42:36.246
- How is that possible?
- It has been absorbed

680
00:42:36.276 --> 00:42:38.182
by the human child.

681
00:42:38.183 --> 00:42:43.344
The key to saving our race
now lies within his mind.

682
00:42:43.384 --> 00:42:47.086
Well then, let me strip
the very flesh from his body.

683
00:42:47.121 --> 00:42:49.068
And you will,
my apprentice.

684
00:42:49.226 --> 00:42:54.088
In time. For millenia,
I have dreamed of my return

685
00:42:54.123 --> 00:42:58.989
to that wretched planet,
where I too was once betrayed,

686
00:42:59.019 --> 00:43:02.946
by the Primes
I call my brothers.

687
00:43:03.539 --> 00:43:10.486
Only a Prime can defeat me,
and now only one remains.

688
00:43:10.488 --> 00:43:14.194
Optimus.
He protects the boy.

689
00:43:14.229 --> 00:43:17.629
Then the boy
will lead us to him

690
00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:23.160
- and revenge will be ours.
- Yes.

691
00:43:24.037 --> 00:43:28.171
The boy will not escape us.
We have him in our sights.

692
00:43:29.528 --> 00:43:33.441
Without more Energon,
hatchlings will keep dying.

693
00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:43.544
Space, time, gravity.

694
00:43:47.122 --> 00:43:49.273
- Thank you.
- Finish that for me.

695
00:43:49.778 --> 00:43:51.814
We're going
on a journey together,

696
00:43:51.854 --> 00:43:53.079
you and I, today.

697
00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:57.920
All you, eager nubile young minds
on the very cusp of adulthood.

698
00:43:58.934 --> 00:44:01.539
And I shall be your consort,
your guide,

699
00:44:02.053 --> 00:44:05.990
your chaperone,
into the heart of darkness.

700
00:44:08.594 --> 00:44:10.332
Welcome to Astronomy 101.

701
00:44:11.933 --> 00:44:15.756
For what do we know
about the stars?

702
00:44:15.991 --> 00:44:19.830
Virgo... the virgin.

703
00:44:20.672 --> 00:44:22.601
Orion, the great hunter.

704
00:44:22.602 --> 00:44:24.790
These are no mere
twinkling diamonds

705
00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:27.283
for lovely maidens
to wish upon.

706
00:44:27.304 --> 00:44:31.635
No, they are diamond,
filled with a throbbing,

707
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:34.457
savage and hemped-up energy.

708
00:44:34.492 --> 00:44:37.134
Behold the work of
Albert Einstein,

709
00:44:37.247 --> 00:44:39.850
a professor once,
like moi,

710
00:44:40.229 --> 00:44:42.233
- energy, in its mass temp...
- What are you doing?

711
00:44:42.234 --> 00:44:43.236
Put your hand down,
put your hand down.

712
00:44:43.237 --> 00:44:45.716
Young man,
there are no questions

713
00:44:45.747 --> 00:44:47.809
until I've reached
the climax of my lecture.

714
00:44:47.844 --> 00:44:49.152
I've just finished your book.
There's only one problem.

715
00:44:49.187 --> 00:44:50.687
Einstein's wrong.

716
00:44:51.898 --> 00:44:53.770
Energy doesn't go
mass times velocity light square

717
00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:55.113
in this dimension.
What about the other 17

718
00:44:55.114 --> 00:44:56.545
while we're impossible
to give 17?

719
00:44:58.282 --> 00:44:59.596
A clear example:

720
00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:17.786
Come on, guys,
I can't be the only one in class...

721
00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:23.457
Young man, I will not be punked
in front of the dean.

722
00:45:24.935 --> 00:45:29.888
No, this is my universe here.
Do you understand?

723
00:45:29.923 --> 00:45:33.542
I am the Alpha
and the Omega.

724
00:45:33.577 --> 00:45:34.917
- Get out of my class.
- Yes, sir.

725
00:45:39.042 --> 00:45:41.533
Any one else care to have
some sort of mental breakdown?

726
00:45:51.573 --> 00:45:54.074
Hi, Bones.
Hi!

727
00:45:54.408 --> 00:45:56.965
Hi! Oh yes,
that's a good boy.

728
00:45:57.396 --> 00:45:59.175
<i>Oh, what a good boy,
you are.</i>

729
00:46:03.936 --> 00:46:05.611
Hey, Bones.

730
00:46:05.653 --> 00:46:06.965
<i>You hungry?</i>

731
00:46:14.426 --> 00:46:15.619
Here you go.

732
00:46:23.573 --> 00:46:25.537
- Yes, Samuel.
- Hello? Mikaela.

733
00:46:25.657 --> 00:46:28.405
I can't believe you're gonna
stand me up on our first web chat date.

734
00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:29.728
Something just happened
to me, okay?

735
00:46:29.729 --> 00:46:31.703
<i>- Wait, you finally hit puberty?
- No, no, no,</i>

736
00:46:31.738 --> 00:46:32.753
Stop laughing.
This is serious.

737
00:46:32.754 --> 00:46:33.669
Okay, remember
I was telling you about

738
00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:35.657
my great-great-grandfather,
Archibald Witwicky?

739
00:46:35.658 --> 00:46:36.525
Do you remember?

740
00:46:36.526 --> 00:46:37.831
Watch where you're
supposed to go!

741
00:46:37.832 --> 00:46:40.223
Okay, remember
I was telling you about, okay...

742
00:46:40.258 --> 00:46:42.119
Can you stop...
Watch the foot! Watch your foot!

743
00:46:42.154 --> 00:46:45.170
Mikaela, okay, my great-great-grandfather
went to this Arctic mission, right?

744
00:46:45.205 --> 00:46:47.021
And he saw Megatron,
Megatron zapped him

745
00:46:47.051 --> 00:46:48.937
and he started seeing
these crazy symbols, okay.

746
00:46:48.971 --> 00:46:50.389
Well, now I'm seeing them too.
Excuse me.

747
00:46:50.408 --> 00:46:53.029
I just wrote a 903-page
Astronomy book at 32.6 seconds

748
00:46:53.064 --> 00:46:54.526
and had a meltdown
in the middle of my class.

749
00:46:54.561 --> 00:46:56.597
I am seeing symbols
ever since I...

750
00:46:57.883 --> 00:47:00.786
- Since what?
- Ever since I touched the Cube sliver.

751
00:47:02.047 --> 00:47:03.357
Do you have it?

752
00:47:03.358 --> 00:47:05.566
No, how about it's in
the shop safe? It's fine.

753
00:47:05.601 --> 00:47:08.741
Mi...Mikaela, do not touch it, okay?
Don't touch it.

754
00:47:08.781 --> 00:47:09.917
<i>I'm not gonna touch it,</i>

755
00:47:09.918 --> 00:47:12.603
Sam, it's fine. It's locked away,
no one knows where it is.

756
00:47:12.828 --> 00:47:14.150
But I do.

757
00:47:15.955 --> 00:47:17.930
You're hot,
but you're ain't too bright.

758
00:47:20.394 --> 00:47:22.167
There we go.

759
00:47:24.478 --> 00:47:26.860
Oh, big son of a bitch!

760
00:47:29.455 --> 00:47:31.568
What are you looking at,
Slobberpuss?

761
00:47:32.690 --> 00:47:34.405
Ah, what the...

762
00:47:34.982 --> 00:47:36.614
This is a fricking
House of Horrors.

763
00:47:42.917 --> 00:47:44.417
Hold on.

764
00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:59.280
Is that the best
you got, huh?

765
00:47:59.315 --> 00:48:00.629
Is that the best
you can do?

766
00:48:02.318 --> 00:48:03.980
What are you doing here,
you little freak?

767
00:48:04.124 --> 00:48:06.955
Ow, that's my eye,
you crazy bitch!

768
00:48:07.029 --> 00:48:08.450
You gotta talk now?

769
00:48:09.227 --> 00:48:12.667
I... I seek knowledge of the Cube.
The Fallen demands me.

770
00:48:12.702 --> 00:48:13.517
What knowledge?

771
00:48:13.518 --> 00:48:15.493
You got the shot, I need the shot,
give me the shot, I need the shot.

772
00:48:15.522 --> 00:48:16.407
Give me the shot,
they're gonna whack me,

773
00:48:16.408 --> 00:48:18.161
I'm gonna be dead
without that shot.

774
00:48:18.162 --> 00:48:21.832
Easy Warrior Goddess,
I'm just a little salvage scrap drone.

775
00:48:21.867 --> 00:48:23.716
- Then I'm your worst nightmare.
- Ow, ow, ow, ow!

776
00:48:24.159 --> 00:48:25.188
Hey, hey!

777
00:48:25.189 --> 00:48:26.678
<i>- What the hell was that?
- I'll tell you later,</i>

778
00:48:26.728 --> 00:48:28.247
just not on
open phone line, okay?

779
00:48:28.286 --> 00:48:30.321
I'm gonna get on a plane right now.
I'll be there later this afternoon.

780
00:48:30.356 --> 00:48:32.002
Just be careful, Sam.

781
00:48:39.776 --> 00:48:42.546
And have any stranger giving you
anything suspicious to carry on today?

782
00:48:42.581 --> 00:48:44.010
Yeah, a large box!

783
00:48:44.403 --> 00:48:45.751
- No.
- Good.

784
00:48:58.392 --> 00:49:01.027
Major, incoming SOS
from Autobots.

785
00:49:01.062 --> 00:49:04.807
Multiple Decepticon contacts in motion.
Vicinity eastern United States, sir.

786
00:49:05.065 --> 00:49:07.748
- Hansvin, how many?
- Unclear, sir.

787
00:49:08.031 --> 00:49:09.635
Well, get clear.

788
00:49:14.286 --> 00:49:17.130
Autobots on the move.
Splitting them into two teams, sir.

789
00:49:17.165 --> 00:49:19.811
Unarching their course, somewhere heading
to New York and Philadelphia.

790
00:49:19.846 --> 00:49:23.416
Full weapons deployment.
Wheels up in 20 minutes!

791
00:49:33.755 --> 00:49:36.421
<i>Flight Chairman
throughout West Beverly Hills.</i>

792
00:49:37.229 --> 00:49:41.252
M'amor (my lover), can I interest you
in Mayteam Zookeeper's Special?

793
00:49:41.333 --> 00:49:43.670
Extra large supertees
with every known animal as a topping.

794
00:49:43.671 --> 00:49:45.702
Basic lengths.
Only 18 inches of meat.

795
00:49:45.756 --> 00:49:47.852
Oh, so you're a vegetarian.
Alright, it's cool. I am too.

796
00:49:48.557 --> 00:49:49.521
Is Sam home?

797
00:49:49.522 --> 00:49:52.776
Sam... I think he died but,
why don't we check?

798
00:49:53.381 --> 00:49:54.727
- Here we are.
- Hey.

799
00:49:55.342 --> 00:49:56.434
Have you had
a song stuck in yours?

800
00:49:56.435 --> 00:49:57.840
It's like the worst song ever,
but you can't help

801
00:49:57.875 --> 00:49:59.452
whistle it or sing it.
It's like, repeats itself,

802
00:49:59.487 --> 00:50:01.648
repeats itself, repeats itself,
repeats itself, repeats itself,

803
00:50:01.649 --> 00:50:03.678
repeats itself...
Kitten calendar, kitten calendar,

804
00:50:03.709 --> 00:50:04.772
- kitten calendar, kitten calendar,
- Dude,

805
00:50:04.773 --> 00:50:05.999
- kitten calendar, kitten calendar,
- What the F?

806
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.096
I know you're freaking out.
Don't freak out, don't freak out.

807
00:50:08.147 --> 00:50:11.014
Easy fix. Puzzle, code, in my head.
Now it's on the walls.

808
00:50:11.049 --> 00:50:11.823
Everything is good.

809
00:50:11.824 --> 00:50:13.214
This is the part that...

810
00:50:17.589 --> 00:50:18.891
Okay,
what were you saying?

811
00:50:18.892 --> 00:50:22.091
Alice, I'm horrified you had
to see this. Let's go.

812
00:50:22.362 --> 00:50:23.787
- Get out.
- What?

813
00:50:23.788 --> 00:50:25.788
Wait, wait, wait.
C-Can I just sit and watch?

814
00:50:25.823 --> 00:50:27.356
I-I'll eat my pizza quietly.

815
00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:30.918
Sam, I knew there were
something special about you.

816
00:50:30.953 --> 00:50:32.066
Really?

817
00:50:33.561 --> 00:50:35.609
And I know you know
what happens

818
00:50:35.874 --> 00:50:37.923
when two people
in the room get together...

819
00:50:39.011 --> 00:50:42.708
they're genuinely amazing...
in bed.

820
00:50:44.079 --> 00:50:45.452
- Thank you.
- No problem.

821
00:50:46.666 --> 00:50:49.301
Alright, listen, hold on.
Boundaries. Flight on the plane.

822
00:50:49.330 --> 00:50:50.645
Okay, I'm very ticklish.

823
00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:53.273
- You have the need, Sam. Relax!
- Why?

824
00:50:53.308 --> 00:50:54.636
Oh, jeez!

825
00:50:55.894 --> 00:50:58.837
Uh, what about this economy?
It's crazy, isn't it?

826
00:51:01.817 --> 00:51:05.065
- You are very aggressive.
- Just relax.

827
00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:06.512
You want
some jerky meatloaf?

828
00:51:12.367 --> 00:51:13.770
Sam?

829
00:51:16.027 --> 00:51:17.167
Mikaela.

830
00:51:17.168 --> 00:51:18.529
Is that your girlfriend?

831
00:51:19.821 --> 00:51:21.317
Ex.

832
00:51:21.777 --> 00:51:26.746
Mikaela, wait...
I can explain every...

833
00:51:46.205 --> 00:51:47.826
Sam, your bed-buddy, Alice.

834
00:52:07.376 --> 00:52:08.398
What...

835
00:52:08.399 --> 00:52:09.501
- It's coming!
- This is an alien robot.

836
00:52:09.502 --> 00:52:11.084
- You gotta move. Just run.
- They're real?

837
00:52:17.966 --> 00:52:20.549
Oh my God, I can't believe
I once had sex with her in my dream.

838
00:52:20.584 --> 00:52:22.194
I can tell that you really
missed me a lot, Sam.

839
00:52:22.224 --> 00:52:23.780
Look, it's not my fault, okay?

840
00:52:24.084 --> 00:52:25.448
Listen, listen.
I'm a victim.

841
00:52:25.468 --> 00:52:26.793
Oh, you were a victim?
Of what?

842
00:52:26.828 --> 00:52:28.910
- Of what? A little 80-pound girl...
- Of...Of...

843
00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:30.678
It's like getting humped
in the neck by a mountain ox.

844
00:52:30.693 --> 00:52:32.074
You didn't have to put
your tongue in her mouth.

845
00:52:32.109 --> 00:52:33.098
- I didn't.
- You did.

846
00:52:33.099 --> 00:52:35.531
Look, you ever had your stomach tounged
by a mountain ox with a 5-foot tong?

847
00:52:35.566 --> 00:52:37.207
It's not fun for me,
okay, Mikaela.

848
00:52:37.242 --> 00:52:40.890
And it smelled like...like diesel.
Like a diesel he dinged to it.

849
00:52:40.925 --> 00:52:42.381
You're such a little girl.

850
00:52:42.416 --> 00:52:44.463
You have ten seconds
of silence, right now.

851
00:52:44.498 --> 00:52:45.768
I'm not talking to you
for ten seconds.

852
00:52:45.769 --> 00:52:47.534
No, you can't give me the silence.
You know what?

853
00:52:47.746 --> 00:52:50.169
I'm not talking to you for ten seconds.
You have three seconds left.

854
00:52:50.204 --> 00:52:51.562
You know, what?
You can give me the silence you want,

855
00:52:51.597 --> 00:52:53.298
all you want but you can't
give me the talking...

856
00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:54.482
W-What were you gonna say?

857
00:52:54.483 --> 00:52:55.949
I hope you had a lot of fun
because this...

858
00:52:55.984 --> 00:52:57.225
This is over!

859
00:52:57.226 --> 00:52:58.493
Did she finally led you
to orbits?

860
00:52:58.494 --> 00:53:01.074
You threw a broom?
She did it, she went in it?

861
00:53:02.779 --> 00:53:04.926
...gestating in that inside of you.
You're going right now, bro.

862
00:53:04.961 --> 00:53:06.989
You need to vomit right now.
Yak it, yak it.

863
00:53:07.090 --> 00:53:09.082
- Right now!
- Who are you?

864
00:53:09.297 --> 00:53:11.418
I am the only one who
everybody can spit, okay?

865
00:53:11.453 --> 00:53:12.453
I'm the key to this.

866
00:53:12.454 --> 00:53:14.031
Aliens; they want me
because of my site.

867
00:53:14.411 --> 00:53:15.465
Whoa!

868
00:53:25.444 --> 00:53:26.701
Run!

869
00:53:30.424 --> 00:53:31.773
Mikaela!

870
00:53:49.472 --> 00:53:51.248
Watch out.
We get in.

871
00:53:51.719 --> 00:53:53.377
It's a bomb!

872
00:54:02.889 --> 00:54:04.553
We gotta get
that box.

873
00:54:07.801 --> 00:54:08.797
This way.

874
00:54:08.798 --> 00:54:10.778
<i>Hey, let me out,
let me out!</i>

875
00:54:11.875 --> 00:54:13.717
Oh my God,
you know to hot-wire a car?

876
00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:15.501
- That's so hot.
- Drive, drive, drive.

877
00:54:15.536 --> 00:54:17.241
She went there,
she went there!

878
00:54:20.401 --> 00:54:21.419
W-wait!

879
00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:23.007
They can....

880
00:54:26.276 --> 00:54:27.872
Cut, cut, cut.

881
00:54:34.717 --> 00:54:36.338
Oh God!

882
00:54:41.724 --> 00:54:43.120
Kiss this, bitch.

883
00:54:48.829 --> 00:54:50.448
Drive, drive, drive,
drive, drive, drive.

884
00:54:53.477 --> 00:54:54.961
Okay, so what else's
going right now, alright,

885
00:54:54.996 --> 00:54:56.445
did you guys just mess
with the minor details?

886
00:54:58.937 --> 00:55:01.083
Thing you saw back there.
That was a little babe.

887
00:55:06.615 --> 00:55:09.007
Whoa!
Oh my God! Oh my God!

888
00:55:12.898 --> 00:55:14.644
Sam!

889
00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:20.328
- Sam!
- Hold on!

890
00:55:20.329 --> 00:55:21.554
Hold on.

891
00:55:23.529 --> 00:55:25.036
Sam!

892
00:55:27.176 --> 00:55:29.981
I don't want to die!
We're going to die! Oh my God!

893
00:55:55.328 --> 00:55:56.965
Oh, Jesus!
Oh, jeez!

894
00:56:05.592 --> 00:56:07.333
Come here, boy.

895
00:56:08.599 --> 00:56:09.948
Closer.

896
00:56:10.904 --> 00:56:11.905
Okay.

897
00:56:11.906 --> 00:56:15.512
- You remember me, don't you?
- I did what you said, okay?

898
00:56:16.674 --> 00:56:18.217
- Just don't hurt us.
- Shut up!

899
00:56:19.129 --> 00:56:20.525
Sam!

900
00:56:30.763 --> 00:56:33.950
It feels good
to grab your first.

901
00:56:35.382 --> 00:56:40.191
I am going to kill you,
slowly, painfully.

902
00:56:40.226 --> 00:56:44.795
But first, we have
some delicate work to do.

903
00:56:48.458 --> 00:56:50.621
I could snap your ribs off.

904
00:56:50.983 --> 00:56:54.790
Doctor, examine
this alien specimen.

905
00:56:57.276 --> 00:56:58.894
Sick of your face now.

906
00:57:20.073 --> 00:57:21.885
Go that way.

907
00:57:29.910 --> 00:57:31.335
A wormy that's crabby...

908
00:57:44.118 --> 00:57:46.659
- Oh, there they are.
- That's what I'm seeing in my head.

909
00:57:46.694 --> 00:57:49.652
These symbols can lead us
to the Energon source.

910
00:57:50.672 --> 00:57:53.196
We must tear the brain!

911
00:57:55.592 --> 00:57:58.529
Brain?
What does he mean by my brain?

912
00:57:58.564 --> 00:58:00.653
Well, you have something
on your mind.

913
00:58:00.687 --> 00:58:03.035
- Something I need.
- Hold on. I know you're pissed.

914
00:58:03.055 --> 00:58:03.763
I know you're pissed.

915
00:58:03.764 --> 00:58:05.662
Because I tried to kill you
and it's completely understandable.

916
00:58:05.697 --> 00:58:07.242
Somebody tried to kill me,
I'd be upset too.

917
00:58:07.278 --> 00:58:09.772
I think that
we have an opportunity here

918
00:58:09.807 --> 00:58:12.826
to start a new and...and
develop our relationship,

919
00:58:13.116 --> 00:58:15.412
and...and,
see where it leads us, okay?

920
00:58:15.447 --> 00:58:16.688
So you just call
doctor inspection,

921
00:58:16.689 --> 00:58:18.336
I'll let you talk
in five seconds.

922
00:58:18.657 --> 00:58:19.797
W-Wait...

923
00:58:26.012 --> 00:58:27.358
Go, go.

924
00:58:31.070 --> 00:58:32.512
Go, go, go.

925
00:58:58.992 --> 00:59:00.487
Sam!

926
00:59:16.492 --> 00:59:17.862
Go, go, go, go!

927
00:59:18.396 --> 00:59:19.940
Here he comes!

928
00:59:26.794 --> 00:59:29.872
Hide, Sam!
Hide.

929
00:59:38.597 --> 00:59:40.278
Weak.

930
00:59:42.168 --> 00:59:43.632
Puny.

931
00:59:43.693 --> 00:59:45.117
Voiced-up.

932
00:59:48.986 --> 00:59:51.617
Junkyard drone.

933
00:59:52.606 --> 00:59:54.375
Decepticons!

934
01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:05.771
Come here, boy.

935
01:00:35.731 --> 01:00:39.162
There is another source of Energon
hidden on this planet.

936
01:00:39.197 --> 01:00:41.275
The boy can lead us to it.

937
01:00:45.835 --> 01:00:47.214
Optimus!

938
01:01:00.506 --> 01:01:06.015
Is the future of our race
not worth a single human life?

939
01:01:06.016 --> 01:01:07.173
Op, get up!

940
01:01:07.174 --> 01:01:09.628
You'll never stop at one.

941
01:01:10.941 --> 01:01:12.872
I'll take you all alive.

942
01:01:54.627 --> 01:01:56.448
Sam, where are you?

943
01:02:00.675 --> 01:02:03.662
You are so weak.

944
01:02:27.781 --> 01:02:32.277
At last, Prime is dead.

945
01:02:40.493 --> 01:02:42.796
Sam, run.

946
01:02:55.346 --> 01:02:56.992
Autobots, attack!

947
01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:03.360
Bumblebee,
get them out of here.

948
01:03:17.306 --> 01:03:18.848
This is Lennox.

949
01:03:31.241 --> 01:03:32.637
That went well.

950
01:03:33.358 --> 01:03:35.036
Lost the boy, Master.

951
01:03:35.076 --> 01:03:37.494
The Autobots must be shielding
the signals.

952
01:03:37.968 --> 01:03:40.278
- I can't even rely on you.
- Sorry. No.

953
01:03:40.308 --> 01:03:42.476
What a simple insect!

954
01:03:43.736 --> 01:03:46.673
- What insect amongst severed billion...
- Shut up.

955
01:03:48.303 --> 01:03:49.949
It could be anywhere.

956
01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:54.137
Then we will force them
to find him for us.

957
01:03:54.451 --> 01:03:57.416
It's time for the world
to know of our presence.

958
01:03:57.711 --> 01:04:00.942
No more disguises,
no mercy!

959
01:04:01.244 --> 01:04:04.865
Time has come
for my master's arrival.

960
01:04:08.736 --> 01:04:12.226
Decepticons, mobilise.

961
01:04:12.227 --> 01:04:14.233
It is time.

962
01:04:28.806 --> 01:04:31.345
<i>Oh, that single's good!</i>

963
01:04:31.546 --> 01:04:33.859
<i>Speaking French
is so exciting.</i>

964
01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:35.716
Oh God,
who is this?

965
01:04:37.671 --> 01:04:40.676
Hello... I mean,
uh, bon...bonswa (good afternoon)!

966
01:04:41.844 --> 01:04:43.825
What?
Who is this?

967
01:04:45.196 --> 01:04:46.697
Oh, for Pete's sakes.

968
01:04:46.891 --> 01:04:49.762
I'm not impressed
with your perverted mouth breathing.

969
01:04:51.201 --> 01:04:53.062
New York City

970
01:05:30.038 --> 01:05:31.344
Oh, jeez.

971
01:05:31.345 --> 01:05:33.949
You are invading my space.
I'm gonna have to drop you.

972
01:05:33.984 --> 01:05:35.356
Would you get out
of here?

973
01:05:35.357 --> 01:05:37.127
Might freak me out.

974
01:05:37.831 --> 01:05:39.105
We're gonna try
new things.

975
01:05:39.106 --> 01:05:40.678
Looks like Candian goosepoop.

976
01:05:43.118 --> 01:05:44.714
It's nasty.

<i>As you've seen,</i>

01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:25.105
I just need you to focus
just one minute, man.

1019
01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:26.902
This thing is blowing
to a whole another level, alright.

1020
01:09:26.937 --> 01:09:28.387
- You know one thing...
- Remove this thing.

1021
01:09:28.388 --> 01:09:29.507
They can track us.
Do you see this?

1022
01:09:29.508 --> 01:09:30.714
What?

1023
01:09:32.646 --> 01:09:34.021
They can track us?

1024
01:09:34.022 --> 01:09:35.562
Like satellite-track us?

1025
01:09:35.755 --> 01:09:37.775
Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay,
I'm not even with you guys.

1026
01:09:37.806 --> 01:09:40.378
Technically, I'm like a hostage.
This is kidnapping. Enough...

1027
01:09:40.408 --> 01:09:41.849
Yo, Leo!

1028
01:09:41.850 --> 01:09:44.103
This thing's gonna give me
a heart attack, I swear.

1029
01:09:44.138 --> 01:09:46.135
- That's 'cause you was a wuss.
- You did force me into the car, right?

1030
01:09:46.170 --> 01:09:47.503
- So...
- Oh, I think you scared.

1031
01:09:47.538 --> 01:09:48.681
Hey, Mudflap.

1032
01:09:48.682 --> 01:09:50.093
What are we going to do
with this shrimp taco?

1033
01:09:50.133 --> 01:09:51.708
Just pop a cap in his ass,
throw him in the trunk

1034
01:09:51.739 --> 01:09:53.068
and nobody gonna know nothing,
y'know I mean?

1035
01:09:53.069 --> 01:09:55.045
- Wait, now my trunk...
- Yo, bumper cars,

1036
01:09:55.046 --> 01:09:56.718
Check it out.
I'm hearing you, okay?

1037
01:09:56.748 --> 01:09:58.518
I'm right here
and I can hear you.

1038
01:09:58.548 --> 01:10:01.122
No one's popping any caps
in any asses, okay?

1039
01:10:01.141 --> 01:10:02.585
I've had a hell of a day.

1040
01:10:03.650 --> 01:10:06.006
Why don't you get a haircut
with your bitch ass?

1041
01:10:06.007 --> 01:10:07.138
Go whine
to your boyfriend.

1042
01:10:07.139 --> 01:10:08.839
Listen Sam, I know
what I'm gonna do, man.

1043
01:10:08.874 --> 01:10:10.003
Look, I'm just going to go
to the authorities

1044
01:10:10.004 --> 01:10:11.500
and tell them the truth.
Like I had nothing to do with this,

1045
01:10:11.519 --> 01:10:12.385
- I'm an accomplice.
- Hey, hey!

1046
01:10:12.386 --> 01:10:13.996
You wanted this, right?
You wanted the real deal?

1047
01:10:14.037 --> 01:10:16.132
'Cause that's what this is.
Wake up! You're in the middle of it.

1048
01:10:16.167 --> 01:10:18.132
You wanna run, go ahead,
no one's stopping you.

1049
01:10:19.439 --> 01:10:21.144
Stop complaining.

1050
01:10:57.322 --> 01:10:58.733
What is the meaning
of this?

1051
01:10:59.169 --> 01:11:01.159
You dare
point your gun at me?

1052
01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:04.991
You want a piece of me?
I will tear you apart!

1053
01:11:06.821 --> 01:11:09.155
Drop your weapons!
Drop your weapons!

1054
01:11:09.190 --> 01:11:10.896
- Tell them to lower the weapons.
- Tell them first.

1055
01:11:10.927 --> 01:11:13.036
- Tell them to lower the weapons!
- Major, there's nothing I can do.

1056
01:11:13.075 --> 01:11:14.151
Talk to him.

1057
01:11:14.152 --> 01:11:16.004
US teams deactivated, Major.

1058
01:11:16.547 --> 01:11:19.146
You are decease
anti-Decepticon operations,

1059
01:11:19.176 --> 01:11:21.549
and return to Diego Garcia.
Any further orders?

1060
01:11:21.580 --> 01:11:23.803
No. We take our orders
direct from Chairman Morshower.

1061
01:11:23.844 --> 01:11:26.019
Well, I'll see your chairman
and the Joint Chiefs of Staff

1062
01:11:26.049 --> 01:11:28.378
but I will raise you
a President of the United States.

1063
01:11:28.418 --> 01:11:30.049
I have operational command now.

1064
01:11:30.084 --> 01:11:32.417
An alien blood feud
has been brought to our shores

1065
01:11:32.453 --> 01:11:34.139
for which our soldiers
are paying the price.

1066
01:11:34.592 --> 01:11:37.612
The secret is out.
This is our war now.

1067
01:11:37.808 --> 01:11:39.489
And we will win it
as we always have,

1068
01:11:39.671 --> 01:11:41.763
with a coordinated
military strategy.

1069
01:11:41.798 --> 01:11:44.441
This fool
is terribly misinformed.

1070
01:11:44.634 --> 01:11:46.200
You're gonna get every assets
that you've got.

1071
01:11:46.235 --> 01:11:47.939
What we need is
to draw our battle plans.

1072
01:11:48.122 --> 01:11:50.315
What we explore every possible,
diplomatic solution.

1073
01:11:50.316 --> 01:11:51.730
Like what:
Handing over the kid?

1074
01:11:53.117 --> 01:11:54.809
All options
are being considered.

1075
01:11:55.593 --> 01:11:57.569
Whatever the Decepticons
are after,

1076
01:11:57.941 --> 01:11:59.390
this is just the start.

1077
01:11:59.511 --> 01:12:01.133
Wait, there is no negotiating
with them.

1078
01:12:01.154 --> 01:12:02.807
I'm ordering you
to stand down.

1079
01:12:02.808 --> 01:12:04.237
You won't be needing this
any more.

1080
01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:06.645
Get your assets
back to base.

1081
01:12:07.157 --> 01:12:09.762
Take that scrap metal
back to Diego Garcia.

1082
01:12:11.625 --> 01:12:12.476
Let's go.

1083
01:12:13.705 --> 01:12:15.385
I really don't
like that dude.

1084
01:12:15.978 --> 01:12:17.841
He's a asshole.

1085
01:12:18.103 --> 01:12:20.519
<i>Autobots,
report to hangar for transport.</i>

1086
01:12:20.721 --> 01:12:23.350
Ironhide,
we should leave this planet.

1087
01:12:23.492 --> 01:12:25.907
That's not what
Optimus would want.

1088
01:12:45.116 --> 01:12:46.837
There's nothing
that you could have done.

1089
01:12:51.672 --> 01:12:53.736
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1090
01:12:56.916 --> 01:12:59.723
Bee, if you hate me,
I understand.

1091
01:13:07.577 --> 01:13:09.247
I messed up.

1092
01:13:10.116 --> 01:13:11.656
I'm sorry.

1093
01:13:12.766 --> 01:13:16.909
- Young fella, you are...
- ...person I care about most in my life.

1094
01:13:16.944 --> 01:13:19.747
- If there's anything you need...
- I won't be far away.

1095
01:13:22.014 --> 01:13:23.399
He's dead
because of me.

1096
01:13:24.168 --> 01:13:25.890
He came in
to protect me instead.

1097
01:13:26.231 --> 01:13:28.914
There's some things
you just can't change.

1098
01:13:28.949 --> 01:13:30.425
So this sacrifice was...

1099
01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:33.158
will not have been in vain,
hallelujah!

1100
01:13:34.628 --> 01:13:36.454
We make it right
when we turn myself in.

1101
01:13:36.697 --> 01:13:38.675
But we,
we've got to stick together.

1102
01:13:43.351 --> 01:13:45.071
You're not gonna do that.

1103
01:13:46.599 --> 01:13:47.835
Yes, I am.

1104
01:13:51.465 --> 01:13:54.152
Everything we worked for
will be wiped out.

1105
01:13:54.153 --> 01:13:55.883
In one day.

1106
01:13:58.088 --> 01:13:59.525
- You two.
- Huh?

1107
01:14:00.079 --> 01:14:01.755
Hey, you know the glyphs?

1108
01:14:02.010 --> 01:14:03.806
The symbols that have been
rattling around in my head.

1109
01:14:04.345 --> 01:14:06.398
That's old school, yo.

1110
01:14:06.399 --> 01:14:08.572
That's like...
That's Cybertonian.

1111
01:14:08.611 --> 01:14:10.178
Oh, that's some
serious stuff in there.

1112
01:14:10.179 --> 01:14:11.835
They gotta mean something,
like a message...

1113
01:14:11.870 --> 01:14:13.222
or, like a...
like a map!

1114
01:14:13.257 --> 01:14:14.800
Like a map
to an Energon source.

1115
01:14:14.813 --> 01:14:16.066
Can you read this?

1116
01:14:16.105 --> 01:14:17.901
- Read? Nah.
- You see that?

1117
01:14:18.312 --> 01:14:19.985
No, we...we don't really do
much reading.

1118
01:14:20.025 --> 01:14:21.298
- Not so much.
- Well if you can't read it,

1119
01:14:21.299 --> 01:14:22.245
we gotta find
somebody who can.

1120
01:14:22.246 --> 01:14:24.302
Oh, look, who came
stashing and back.

1121
01:14:24.337 --> 01:14:25.991
Hair grown like a chip,
there, look it.

1122
01:14:26.026 --> 01:14:28.164
I had a bit of a mild
panic attack earlier, alright?

1123
01:14:28.195 --> 01:14:29.483
That's 'cause
you're a pussy.

1124
01:14:29.484 --> 01:14:31.172
I think I'm allowed that
considering what I've been through

1125
01:14:31.202 --> 01:14:32.731
and... I heard
you have a problem.

1126
01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:34.382
I think I know someone
who can help.

1127
01:14:34.637 --> 01:14:36.970
- Who?
- Robo-Warrior.

1128
01:14:37.844 --> 01:14:40.603
[SONG: New Divide
BAND: Linkin Park]

1129
01:14:40.745 --> 01:14:42.049
This guy, Robo-Warrior...

1130
01:14:42.050 --> 01:14:44.601
Everything about anything alien,
he's supposed to know.

1131
01:14:44.636 --> 01:14:46.003
One time
we hacked this site

1132
01:14:46.032 --> 01:14:50.677
and maybe, I saw some of your, uh...
alien drawings or whatever.

1133
01:15:03.132 --> 01:15:04.396
This is it.

1134
01:15:04.510 --> 01:15:06.248
Yep, deli. Good front.

1135
01:15:06.702 --> 01:15:09.119
Alright, wait here.
I'll give you the go/no go, alright?

1136
01:15:09.967 --> 01:15:15.253
Number 42, we got your...
Right here...

1137
01:15:15.254 --> 01:15:17.054
Show me Who's next?

1138
01:15:20.370 --> 01:15:21.987
Ma, you want me
to cut my handle off or what?

1139
01:15:22.017 --> 01:15:25.042
- You order a terrible piece of fishing.
- I'm like a ninja, with a blade.

1140
01:15:25.062 --> 01:15:26.159
Get out of here!

1141
01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:28.581
Hey, Sam!
Watch your reach, huh?

1142
01:15:28.601 --> 01:15:30.070
Take a number,
young man.

1143
01:15:30.665 --> 01:15:32.332
Robo-Warrior.

1144
01:15:33.827 --> 01:15:34.860
Know him?

1145
01:15:34.861 --> 01:15:36.005
I never heard of him.

1146
01:15:36.006 --> 01:15:38.316
You never heard of
TheRealEffingDeal.com?

1147
01:15:38.317 --> 01:15:41.157
You must be talking about
that amateur blog operation

1148
01:15:41.192 --> 01:15:43.366
with GameBoy level security.

1149
01:15:43.367 --> 01:15:45.072
Robo-Warrior.

1150
01:15:45.356 --> 01:15:47.398
It's him. It's him!
That's the guy right there.

1151
01:15:47.433 --> 01:15:48.863
That's him.

1152
01:15:49.427 --> 01:15:50.879
No.

1153
01:15:51.385 --> 01:15:52.419
You gotta be kidding me.

1154
01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:54.923
Alright, meat store's closed.
Everybody out!

1155
01:15:54.924 --> 01:15:56.554
Go, right now!

1156
01:15:57.811 --> 01:15:59.232
Wait a minute,
you know this guy?

1157
01:15:59.233 --> 01:16:00.716
- We're old friends.
- Whoa, friend,

1158
01:16:00.751 --> 01:16:03.429
you are the case
that shut down Sector 7.

1159
01:16:03.430 --> 01:16:04.971
Got the tie-bash
disbandment,

1160
01:16:05.006 --> 01:16:08.323
no more security clearance,
no retirement, no nothing.

1161
01:16:08.358 --> 01:16:11.415
All 'cause of you,
and your little criminal girlfriend.

1162
01:16:11.444 --> 01:16:12.984
Look at her now,
so mature.

1163
01:16:12.985 --> 01:16:15.361
Moron, where's the wifresh?

1164
01:16:15.396 --> 01:16:17.738
Don't catch me
with the thing.

1165
01:16:17.798 --> 01:16:19.117
- Yakov!
- What?

1166
01:16:19.298 --> 01:16:21.379
You don't get Christmas bonus
just standing around.

1167
01:16:21.503 --> 01:16:23.352
You want those new teeth
you saw in SkyMall?

1168
01:16:23.589 --> 01:16:25.470
- It's my dream.
- Help around.

1169
01:16:26.324 --> 01:16:28.056
- You live with your momma?
- No, my momma lives with me.

1170
01:16:28.066 --> 01:16:29.015
It's a big difference.

1171
01:16:29.016 --> 01:16:30.747
They got your face
all over the news, alien boy.

1172
01:16:30.782 --> 01:16:32.905
- Yeah, I know.
- And NBE-1, still kicking, huh?

1173
01:16:33.162 --> 01:16:34.445
How did that happen?

1174
01:16:34.446 --> 01:16:36.500
Don't answer.
I don't know what you're hiding,

1175
01:16:36.535 --> 01:16:37.854
but I don't want anything
to do with it

1176
01:16:37.855 --> 01:16:40.184
so, goodbye, you never saw me.
I got bagels to schmidt.

1177
01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:41.887
Well, give me 5 seconds.

1178
01:16:41.888 --> 01:16:43.376
Look, hold on,
I need your help.

1179
01:16:43.412 --> 01:16:45.836
Really,
you need my help?

1180
01:16:46.127 --> 01:16:46.989
I need...

1181
01:16:46.990 --> 01:16:49.289
Look, I am slowly
losing my mind, okay?

1182
01:16:49.382 --> 01:16:51.194
I had a little Crabbot,
placed the device

1183
01:16:51.224 --> 01:16:52.749
deep into the soft tissues
of my brain,

1184
01:16:52.784 --> 01:16:54.466
and started projecting
little alien symbols

1185
01:16:54.501 --> 01:16:55.494
like a whole freaking movie

1186
01:16:55.495 --> 01:16:57.246
and on top of that,
I'm a wanted fugitive.

1187
01:16:57.281 --> 01:16:58.439
So you think
you got it rough?

1188
01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:00.613
You said it projected images
of your brain?

1189
01:17:00.614 --> 01:17:01.939
Right.

1190
01:17:02.056 --> 01:17:03.373
Meat locker, now!

1191
01:17:03.991 --> 01:17:05.263
- Dead pigs.
- Yuck.

1192
01:17:05.264 --> 01:17:07.218
What you're about to see
is top secret.

1193
01:17:08.184 --> 01:17:10.095
Do not tell my mother.

1194
01:17:11.214 --> 01:17:12.385
Dead pigs, swine flu.

1195
01:17:12.386 --> 01:17:13.531
- Not good.
- Now you know.

1196
01:17:13.532 --> 01:17:15.271
Next time, you eat
a goat or a pig.

1197
01:17:15.272 --> 01:17:16.557
There's a story
behind this.

1198
01:17:16.558 --> 01:17:17.873
Yeah,
there's a story.

1199
01:17:18.277 --> 01:17:20.142
<i>...you're saying
you believe in aliens?</i>

1200
01:17:20.177 --> 01:17:21.503
Okay, files, files.

1201
01:17:21.655 --> 01:17:23.287
We're talking about symbols.

1202
01:17:24.005 --> 01:17:26.370
Hey! Still radioactive.
Hands off.

1203
01:17:27.534 --> 01:17:28.930
Okay, Cube-brain.

1204
01:17:29.983 --> 01:17:32.036
Any of these look like
the symbols you saw?

1205
01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:33.727
Where did you get these?

1206
01:17:33.728 --> 01:17:35.274
Before I got fired.

1207
01:17:35.277 --> 01:17:37.833
I coached S-7's
scrawny, drooly...

1208
01:17:37.868 --> 01:17:42.898
75 years of alien research
which points to one inescapable fact:

1209
01:17:42.933 --> 01:17:47.526
The Transformers;
they've been here a long, long time.

1210
01:17:47.561 --> 01:17:48.704
How do I know?

1211
01:17:49.603 --> 01:17:51.568
Archaeologists found
these unexplained markings

1212
01:17:51.603 --> 01:17:54.039
and ancient runes
all over the world.

1213
01:17:54.382 --> 01:17:56.397
China, Egypt, Greece.

1214
01:17:57.212 --> 01:17:58.659
Shot at 1932.

1215
01:17:59.001 --> 01:18:00.669
These the symbols
you're seeing in your head?

1216
01:18:00.861 --> 01:18:03.150
- Yeah.
- Same ones over here, right?

1217
01:18:03.864 --> 01:18:08.008
So, tell me, how did they end up
all drawing the same thing?

1218
01:18:09.424 --> 01:18:10.827
Aliens.

1219
01:18:10.828 --> 01:18:12.525
And I think
some of them stayed.

1220
01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:13.615
Check this out.

1221
01:18:13.616 --> 01:18:15.534
Project Black Knife.

1222
01:18:15.866 --> 01:18:19.581
Robots, in disguise.
Hiding here.

1223
01:18:19.864 --> 01:18:20.586
All along.

1224
01:18:20.587 --> 01:18:23.682
We detected radioactive signatures
all across the country.

1225
01:18:23.925 --> 01:18:27.370
I pleaded on my knees
with S-7 to investigate it

1226
01:18:27.390 --> 01:18:30.978
but they said
the readings were infantesimal.

1227
01:18:31.013 --> 01:18:33.673
That I was obsessed!

1228
01:18:33.745 --> 01:18:35.294
Me, can you imagine that?

1229
01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:38.694
Megatron said that there was
another Energon source here.

1230
01:18:38.729 --> 01:18:40.499
- On Earth? On another source?
- On Earth.

1231
01:18:40.696 --> 01:18:41.780
Okay,
and that these symbols,

1232
01:18:41.781 --> 01:18:43.337
the maps in my head
would lead him there.

1233
01:18:43.602 --> 01:18:45.351
Should you talk
to your Autobot friends?

1234
01:18:45.375 --> 01:18:46.622
No, no, no,
the source is before.

1235
01:18:46.623 --> 01:18:49.249
Whatever the Energon source is,
it predates them. It's before them.

1236
01:18:49.523 --> 01:18:51.022
- So it comes before that.
- Correct.

1237
01:18:51.837 --> 01:18:53.251
Well then, report...

1238
01:18:53.252 --> 01:18:55.005
Unless we can talk
to a Decepticon.

1239
01:18:55.517 --> 01:18:57.650
I mean, I'm not on
speed terms or whatever...

1240
01:18:57.679 --> 01:18:59.150
Actually, I am.

1241
01:19:03.732 --> 01:19:05.259
Let me out!

1242
01:19:05.572 --> 01:19:07.434
- It could be a little bit sad.
- Open it.

1243
01:19:09.333 --> 01:19:11.887
I'm gonna so many Decepticons
on your butt!

1244
01:19:12.025 --> 01:19:13.026
Behave.

1245
01:19:13.027 --> 01:19:14.558
- What is it, a Decepticon?
- Yeah.

1246
01:19:14.823 --> 01:19:16.706
- Can you train him?
- Tried to.

1247
01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:20.108
I spent my whole adult life,
coming a plan of aliens.

1248
01:19:20.143 --> 01:19:21.656
- You're very furious...
- And you're carrying it around

1249
01:19:21.686 --> 01:19:23.436
what are you supposed to make
a little chihuahua.

1250
01:19:24.356 --> 01:19:26.479
Wanna throw it down,
you pubic fro-head?

1251
01:19:26.790 --> 01:19:29.494
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry about your eye.

1252
01:19:29.947 --> 01:19:31.366
You know,
but if you're a good boy,

1253
01:19:31.623 --> 01:19:33.385
then I'm not gonna torch
your other eye.

1254
01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:34.756
Okay?
I'm not gonna torch it.

1255
01:19:34.791 --> 01:19:36.764
Just tell me
what these symbols are.

1256
01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:38.372
Please.

1257
01:19:39.456 --> 01:19:40.658
Okay.

1258
01:19:41.473 --> 01:19:44.433
Oh, I know that.
That's the language of the Primes.

1259
01:19:45.799 --> 01:19:47.817
I don't read it, but uh,
these guys...

1260
01:19:48.293 --> 01:19:51.031
Where the frick did you find
photos of these guys?

1261
01:19:51.267 --> 01:19:52.280
- Is this them?
- Yeah.

1262
01:19:52.281 --> 01:19:54.958
Sakers, pal.
Oldest of the old.

1263
01:19:55.067 --> 01:19:56.651
Oh, they've been here for
thousands of years,

1264
01:19:56.681 --> 01:19:57.932
looking for something.

1265
01:19:57.933 --> 01:19:59.752
I don't know what,
nobody tells me nothing.

1266
01:19:59.787 --> 01:20:01.941
Oh, they'll translate
those symbols for ya.

1267
01:20:02.103 --> 01:20:03.603
And I know
where to find them.

1268
01:20:03.638 --> 01:20:04.904
Show us.

1269
01:20:09.509 --> 01:20:11.335
Closest one's
in Washington.

1270
01:20:13.943 --> 01:20:16.800
Smithsonian
Air and Space Museum.

1271
01:20:16.803 --> 01:20:19.140
Land of dreams
in there.

1272
01:20:19.734 --> 01:20:21.674
All I ever want to be
was an astronaut.

1273
01:20:23.473 --> 01:20:25.102
- Hold those.
- What is that?

1274
01:20:26.088 --> 01:20:27.103
What?

1275
01:20:27.104 --> 01:20:28.706
I wear them
when I'm in the funk.

1276
01:20:29.663 --> 01:20:32.691
So does Jeamby, Cheater.
It's a baseball thing.

1277
01:20:32.692 --> 01:20:35.750
Okay. Once you synchronize,
shop-mind and empty bladder

1278
01:20:35.785 --> 01:20:38.803
you get caught, demand an attorney
and don't ever say my name.

1279
01:20:38.838 --> 01:20:39.892
Here, take one
of these pills.

1280
01:20:39.893 --> 01:20:40.621
Slip it
under your tongue,

1281
01:20:40.622 --> 01:20:43.052
it's a high-concentrate polymer
they put in Oreo cookies.

1282
01:20:43.087 --> 01:20:44.884
Fools the polygraph,
everytime.

1283
01:20:44.919 --> 01:20:46.862
Okay, now let's get this show
on the road.

1284
01:20:47.318 --> 01:20:49.266
Whoa, no, listen.
I can't do this.

1285
01:20:49.296 --> 01:20:50.528
I'm not some
alien bounty hunter, alright?

1286
01:20:50.529 --> 01:20:51.853
'cause I'm not gonna do this.
Guards have guns,

1287
01:20:51.884 --> 01:20:53.508
- I don't want to die.
- Kid, kid, kid, kid, kid, kid.

1288
01:20:54.011 --> 01:20:56.657
You compromise this mission,
you are dead to me.

1289
01:20:56.716 --> 01:20:59.887
Now look into my eyes,
and tighten up that spare tank.

1290
01:21:00.267 --> 01:21:01.943
<i>The museum
is now closing.</i>

1291
01:21:02.337 --> 01:21:03.712
Papa, bad news, bro.

1292
01:21:03.753 --> 01:21:05.721
Ran out of toilet paper,
you got any out here?

1293
01:21:05.751 --> 01:21:07.917
- Please tell me you...
- Sir, I suggest you get in there.

1294
01:21:07.952 --> 01:21:09.414
The museum is closed.

1295
01:21:09.449 --> 01:21:12.114
Listen man, I understand that,
but as you can see, this is important.

1296
01:21:12.115 --> 01:21:13.944
Dumper-dumper.
I gotta go, alright?

1297
01:21:13.945 --> 01:21:16.600
Sir, you are a grown naked man
around showing...

1298
01:21:16.901 --> 01:21:19.554
- Pull your pants up and exit...
- I'm not going anywhere.

1299
01:21:24.458 --> 01:21:25.774
You got that paper,
right, sir?

1300
01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:27.098
You should be embarassed.

1301
01:21:27.099 --> 01:21:28.784
This a family museum, sir.

1302
01:21:47.436 --> 01:21:49.056
What is going on here?

1303
01:21:49.091 --> 01:21:50.994
How many times
can you get tased in the nuts?

1304
01:21:50.995 --> 01:21:53.540
So you covered the gates,
huh, you know.

1305
01:21:53.575 --> 01:21:56.028
You're an amateur man,
a rank amateur.

1306
01:21:59.596 --> 01:22:01.514
There's now five guards.
Five guards.

1307
01:22:01.724 --> 01:22:03.157
- You get this stuff and get out of here.
- Give me a second.

1308
01:22:03.453 --> 01:22:04.769
I gotta get
the tracker, alright.

1309
01:22:05.424 --> 01:22:07.663
- Be good.
- I'm claustrophobic.

1310
01:22:24.627 --> 01:22:26.833
Look, look.
Follow him, follow him.

1311
01:22:26.868 --> 01:22:28.187
He knows
where he's going.

1312
01:22:33.574 --> 01:22:34.822
- He knows something.
- What?

1313
01:22:34.823 --> 01:22:36.534
He knows something!

1314
01:22:42.228 --> 01:22:43.513
- You got what I got?
- Yeah.

1315
01:22:43.514 --> 01:22:44.913
Blackbird.

1316
01:22:47.753 --> 01:22:49.266
There he is.

1317
01:22:49.301 --> 01:22:53.135
This guy's a legend,
like...like the Chairman of the Board.

1318
01:22:53.170 --> 01:22:54.899
Yo, freshman,
put the shard.

1319
01:22:55.392 --> 01:22:57.483
And watch
the magic happen.

1320
01:23:04.543 --> 01:23:06.602
Oh shit,
it's a Decepticon!

1321
01:23:07.045 --> 01:23:08.680
- Decepticon?
- What is it?

1322
01:23:09.253 --> 01:23:10.635
Find the main tail!

1323
01:23:23.271 --> 01:23:26.077
What sort of hideous
mosalleem is this?

1324
01:23:27.651 --> 01:23:30.922
Semi pulls and days,
show yourselves!

1325
01:23:30.923 --> 01:23:33.172
Or suffer my infinite wrath!

1326
01:23:34.589 --> 01:23:37.342
W-wait, old spinal called
based organisms.

1327
01:23:38.514 --> 01:23:39.852
Bugger!

1328
01:23:40.429 --> 01:23:44.869
Behold the eternal glory
of Jetfire!

1329
01:23:44.904 --> 01:23:47.018
Prepare
for a systems' override.

1330
01:23:47.053 --> 01:23:48.532
I tell you, this guy
did not age well.

1331
01:23:48.568 --> 01:23:51.426
- He either heard it.
- Command these doors to open.

1332
01:23:51.708 --> 01:23:52.957
Fire!

1333
01:23:52.958 --> 01:23:55.590
Oh, I said, fire!

1334
01:23:56.643 --> 01:23:57.936
Bollocks.

1335
01:23:57.937 --> 01:24:00.063
Break that,
these worthless...

1336
01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:01.807
Wait a second.

1337
01:24:01.808 --> 01:24:05.335
Itching, wretching,
rust in my arse.

1338
01:24:05.826 --> 01:24:08.656
Oh, the museum's gonna be
very angry.

1339
01:24:08.691 --> 01:24:11.007
Very angry.
We gotta catch that plane!

1340
01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:16.180
I'm on a mission.

1341
01:24:16.853 --> 01:24:18.216
- W-wait, wait!
- Wait, wait, wait.

1342
01:24:18.226 --> 01:24:19.414
- Hey!
- What do you want?

1343
01:24:19.415 --> 01:24:20.559
Look,
we just want to talk!

1344
01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:22.418
I've no time to talk,
I'm on a mission!

1345
01:24:22.453 --> 01:24:24.273
I'm a mercenary goon-bringer.

1346
01:24:24.308 --> 01:24:26.357
- What planet am I on?
- Earth.

1347
01:24:26.399 --> 01:24:28.410
Earth?
Terrible name for a planet,

1348
01:24:28.445 --> 01:24:30.404
might as well
call it "dirt".

1349
01:24:30.405 --> 01:24:32.352
Planet dirt.

1350
01:24:32.393 --> 01:24:35.332
Tell me, is that robot civil war
still going on?

1351
01:24:35.897 --> 01:24:37.446
- Who's winning?
- The Decepticons.

1352
01:24:38.501 --> 01:24:40.675
Well, I changed sides
to the Autobots.

1353
01:24:40.710 --> 01:24:42.123
What do you mean,
"changed sides"?

1354
01:24:42.158 --> 01:24:43.135
It's a choice.

1355
01:24:43.136 --> 01:24:47.493
It's intensely personal decision.
So much negativity.

1356
01:24:47.553 --> 01:24:49.605
Who wants to live a life
filled with hate?

1357
01:24:49.639 --> 01:24:50.746
Meaning you don't have
to work for those

1358
01:24:50.747 --> 01:24:52.243
miserable,
freaking Decepticons?

1359
01:24:52.284 --> 01:24:55.655
If they set on their way,
they destroy the whole Universe.

1360
01:24:56.124 --> 01:24:58.443
I'm changing sides,
I'm changing sides, Warrior Goddess!

1361
01:24:58.806 --> 01:25:01.110
- Who's your little Autobot?
- Oh you cutes.

1362
01:25:01.143 --> 01:25:02.410
Name's Wheelie.

1363
01:25:02.533 --> 01:25:04.060
Say my name,
say my name!

1364
01:25:04.650 --> 01:25:06.348
What are you allowing
to happen to your foot just now?

1365
01:25:06.383 --> 01:25:07.649
At least he's faithful, Sam.

1366
01:25:07.650 --> 01:25:10.264
Yeah, well, he's faithful,
and he's nude and he's perverted.

1367
01:25:12.073 --> 01:25:13.345
Can you just...
Can you stop?

1368
01:25:13.346 --> 01:25:15.607
- Hey, what are you doing?
- ...I don't wanna argue it.

1369
01:25:15.641 --> 01:25:16.815
What were you saying?

1370
01:25:16.847 --> 01:25:19.056
I told you
my name was Jetfire!

1371
01:25:20.846 --> 01:25:22.813
Wow, someone shit in the bed
this morning?

1372
01:25:25.047 --> 01:25:26.592
Pretty stout
with my mother.

1373
01:25:26.714 --> 01:25:29.238
My ancestors have been here
for centuries.

1374
01:25:29.274 --> 01:25:32.091
My father, one was a wheel!
The first wheel!

1375
01:25:32.126 --> 01:25:34.140
- Do you know what he transformed into?
- No.

1376
01:25:34.395 --> 01:25:39.345
Nothing!
But he did so with honor, dignity and...

1377
01:25:47.428 --> 01:25:49.817
My boosters are fried.

1378
01:25:51.396 --> 01:25:52.905
I thought
we could help each other.

1379
01:25:52.906 --> 01:25:55.397
You know things I don't know.
I know things you don't know.

1380
01:25:55.398 --> 01:25:56.910
- I do.
- I don't think he knows anything.

1381
01:25:56.945 --> 01:25:58.573
Honestly, I don't know.

1382
01:26:01.727 --> 01:26:02.698
These vivid symbols,

1383
01:26:02.699 --> 01:26:04.368
they're symbols
but they are in my mind.

1384
01:26:04.408 --> 01:26:05.733
You see,
all this is in my mind.

1385
01:26:05.734 --> 01:26:07.706
And Megatron
wants what's in my mind.

1386
01:26:07.707 --> 01:26:09.032
Him and someone called
the Fallen.

1387
01:26:09.033 --> 01:26:12.564
The Fallen? I know him.
He left me here to rust.

1388
01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:13.984
The original Decepticon.

1389
01:26:14.012 --> 01:26:17.451
He's terrible to work for.
He's always apocalypse, chaos...

1390
01:26:18.269 --> 01:26:20.350
His suspects,
they were a part of my mission

1391
01:26:20.380 --> 01:26:22.122
the Fall and Search,
I remember now.

1392
01:26:22.162 --> 01:26:24.729
Of a dagger's tip
and the key!

1393
01:26:25.013 --> 01:26:26.856
Slow down.
The dagger's tip, the key,

1394
01:26:26.891 --> 01:26:28.298
- what are you talking about?
- No time to explain.

1395
01:26:28.299 --> 01:26:29.867
Hold on, everybody!

1396
01:26:57.582 --> 01:26:59.230
Well, that wasn't so bad.

1397
01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:01.106
I was overseeing
the wrong planet.

1398
01:27:01.146 --> 01:27:03.072
Hey, that frickin' hurt!

1399
01:27:04.721 --> 01:27:06.085
Oh, my God!

1400
01:27:12.723 --> 01:27:14.774
Oh, God!

1401
01:27:18.906 --> 01:27:22.270
Oh, my God! You beautiful face,
this will be a perfect moment.

1402
01:27:22.341 --> 01:27:24.327
Except you landed
on my testicles.

1403
01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:26.168
Please get off!

1404
01:27:29.066 --> 01:27:30.525
My balls!

1405
01:27:30.986 --> 01:27:32.573
Sam!

1406
01:27:33.503 --> 01:27:36.783
- Where are we? Simmons!
- Hey! Yeah!

1407
01:27:36.784 --> 01:27:38.420
Oh, my God.

1408
01:27:39.439 --> 01:27:41.763
What is this?
It's Vegas!

1409
01:27:41.798 --> 01:27:43.457
- You guys okay?
- Yeah!

1410
01:27:43.458 --> 01:27:46.364
Hey! I think
we're in Vegas!

1411
01:27:46.365 --> 01:27:47.861
That really, really hurts.

1412
01:27:47.902 --> 01:27:50.125
You're just lucky
that I didn't get hurt.

1413
01:27:50.126 --> 01:27:52.716
People could've gotten killed, okay?
And if I would have gotten hurt,

1414
01:27:52.717 --> 01:27:54.859
- you would have heard from...
- Oh, shut up!

1415
01:27:54.899 --> 01:27:56.675
I told you
I was opening the space bridge.

1416
01:27:56.705 --> 01:27:58.965
It's the fastest way
to travel to Egypt.

1417
01:27:58.966 --> 01:28:01.463
What did you tell us?
You didn't tell us anything!

1418
01:28:01.891 --> 01:28:04.025
You didn't tell us anything.
Why are we in Egypt?

1419
01:28:04.026 --> 01:28:06.718
Don't you dare
slip in with me, fleshwing.

1420
01:28:07.244 --> 01:28:09.631
- You would do the informed.
- Can you just stop for a second?

1421
01:28:09.661 --> 01:28:11.593
Can you focus?
Can you tell us why we're in Egypt

1422
01:28:11.628 --> 01:28:14.297
so we can all have a little bit
assemblance and peace of mind?

1423
01:28:14.298 --> 01:28:17.573
This planet was visited
by our race once before

1424
01:28:17.574 --> 01:28:20.485
by our earliest ancestors
a millenium ago.

1425
01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:23.520
They were on an exploratory mission
to harvest Energon,

1426
01:28:23.555 --> 01:28:26.144
the life blood
of our race.

1427
01:28:26.179 --> 01:28:29.116
Without it, we'll all perish,
oxidize and rust,

1428
01:28:29.151 --> 01:28:31.098
let my wretched self.

1429
01:28:31.133 --> 01:28:35.318
Do you have any idea what is
like a slowly fall of parton die?

1430
01:28:35.354 --> 01:28:38.193
Let's not get episodic, okay?
Old-timer.

1431
01:28:38.645 --> 01:28:44.088
Beginning, middle, end.
Facts, details, condense, plot, tell it.

1432
01:28:44.089 --> 01:28:49.071
Somewhere buried in this desert,
our ancestors built a great machine.

1433
01:28:49.242 --> 01:28:53.343
It harvests Energon
by destroying suns.

1434
01:28:53.453 --> 01:28:55.186
- Destroy suns?
- You mean blow them up?

1435
01:28:55.206 --> 01:28:58.857
Yes. You see, in the beginning,
there were seven Primes,

1436
01:28:58.897 --> 01:29:00.549
our original leaders.

1437
01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:04.564
And they set out in the Universe
seeking distant suns to harvest.

1438
01:29:05.155 --> 01:29:07.462
The Primes set out
with one rule:

1439
01:29:07.463 --> 01:29:10.610
Never destroy a planet
with life.

1440
01:29:10.611 --> 01:29:13.707
Until one of them
tried to defy this rule.

1441
01:29:13.742 --> 01:29:17.957
And his name, for ever more,
was the Fallen.

1442
01:29:19.667 --> 01:29:22.007
He despised
the human race.

1443
01:29:23.134 --> 01:29:27.216
And he wanted to kill you all
by turning on that machine.

1444
01:29:27.251 --> 01:29:31.651
The only way to activate it
is with a legendary key

1445
01:29:31.652 --> 01:29:34.781
called the Matrix of Leadership.

1446
01:29:41.048 --> 01:29:45.538
A great battle took place
over possession of the Matrix.

1447
01:29:49.923 --> 01:29:52.512
The Fallen who was
stronger at his will did,

1448
01:29:53.667 --> 01:29:58.660
surrendered no choice,
but to steal and hide it from him.

1449
01:29:59.145 --> 01:30:03.970
In the ultimate sacrifice, they gave
their lives to seal the Matrix away

1450
01:30:04.005 --> 01:30:07.300
in a tomb made of
their very own bodies.

1451
01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:10.914
A tomb
we cannot find.

1452
01:30:12.224 --> 01:30:15.129
Somewhere,
buried in this desert,

1453
01:30:15.165 --> 01:30:17.767
that deadly machine
remains.

1454
01:30:17.803 --> 01:30:20.000
The Fallen knows
where it is.

1455
01:30:20.035 --> 01:30:25.878
And if he finds the Tomb of the Primes,
your world will be no more.

1456
01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:27.658
Okay so how do we stop it?

1457
01:30:27.693 --> 01:30:29.839
Only a Prime
can defeat the Fallen.

1458
01:30:30.376 --> 01:30:31.945
Optimus Prime?

1459
01:30:34.285 --> 01:30:36.370
So you met a Prime?

1460
01:30:36.988 --> 01:30:39.532
You must have met
a great descendant.

1461
01:30:39.567 --> 01:30:40.735
Is he alive?

1462
01:30:40.736 --> 01:30:43.045
Here?
On this planet?

1463
01:30:43.340 --> 01:30:45.609
He sacrificed himself
to save me.

1464
01:30:46.346 --> 01:30:47.767
So he's dead.

1465
01:30:47.768 --> 01:30:49.635
Without a Prime,
it's impossible.

1466
01:30:49.936 --> 01:30:52.046
No one else
could stop the Fallen.

1467
01:30:52.082 --> 01:30:55.243
So the same energy that's going
to be used to reactivate the machine...

1468
01:30:55.975 --> 01:30:58.945
Could that energy somehow be used
to reactivate Optimus

1469
01:30:58.981 --> 01:30:59.982
and bring him
back to life?

1470
01:30:59.983 --> 01:31:01.993
It was never designed
for that purpose,

1471
01:31:02.029 --> 01:31:04.732
but it's an energy,
like no other.

1472
01:31:04.924 --> 01:31:08.863
So then how do you get us to the Matrix
before the Decepticons get to me?

1473
01:31:08.898 --> 01:31:12.176
Follow your mind, your map,
your symbols,

1474
01:31:12.211 --> 01:31:14.822
what you got in the sand,
it's your bloom.

1475
01:31:14.857 --> 01:31:17.080
When dawn alights
the Dagger's tip,

1476
01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:19.913
three kings will reveal
the doorway.

1477
01:31:19.947 --> 01:31:22.066
Find the doorway!

1478
01:31:22.101 --> 01:31:23.601
Go now, go!

1479
01:31:23.854 --> 01:31:26.825
That was my mission.
It's your mission now.

1480
01:31:26.860 --> 01:31:29.370
Go before
the Decepticons find me

1481
01:31:29.490 --> 01:31:31.377
and find you.

1482
01:31:37.701 --> 01:31:39.079
That was
my CIA contact.

1483
01:31:39.119 --> 01:31:41.539
Says Ancient Sumerian used to call
the Gulf of Aqaba

1484
01:31:41.589 --> 01:31:43.792
- the Dagger's Tip.
- That's the dagger's tip.

1485
01:31:43.827 --> 01:31:45.007
- It's part of the Red Sea.
- Got it.

1486
01:31:45.008 --> 01:31:47.214
It divides Egypt and Jordan
like the tip of a blade.

1487
01:31:47.249 --> 01:31:49.906
29 and a half degrees North.
35 East.

1488
01:31:50.341 --> 01:31:51.351
There it is.

1489
01:31:51.352 --> 01:31:53.538
Okay, first thing we gotta do
is get Optimus to Dagger's Tip.

1490
01:31:53.574 --> 01:31:55.171
How are you gonna get him
halfway around the world?

1491
01:31:55.984 --> 01:31:57.375
We're gonna make a call.

1492
01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:01.621
We got the cops.

1493
01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:09.258
I can't go to prison, guys!

1494
01:32:12.723 --> 01:32:15.373
Sam, you gotta get off
this road and lay low.

1495
01:32:25.968 --> 01:32:27.897
Man, they'll pick up.

1496
01:32:27.932 --> 01:32:30.179
This is just called
blending in like a ninja.

1497
01:32:30.351 --> 01:32:32.041
How about I'll lay my piss
in your face?

1498
01:32:33.044 --> 01:32:34.310
They're gone.

1499
01:32:34.543 --> 01:32:35.693
Wait another time.

1500
01:32:35.694 --> 01:32:36.869
How are you gonna make
the call to Lennox?

1501
01:32:36.870 --> 01:32:39.328
You are in the worldwide. What,
they're gonna tranquil in one base?

1502
01:32:39.363 --> 01:32:40.811
They'll track you here
in seconds.

1503
01:32:40.812 --> 01:32:42.766
CIA is all over this place.

1504
01:32:42.778 --> 01:32:44.242
You're gonna call?

1505
01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:51.003
Okay,
that's...that's a good idea.

1506
01:32:51.004 --> 01:32:52.653
- Alright?
- I mean I just was...

1507
01:32:53.123 --> 01:32:54.257
My mind in other things.

1508
01:32:54.258 --> 01:32:55.868
Like why don't you get
being chipped in prison.

1509
01:32:56.735 --> 01:32:58.083
New Jersey

1510
01:32:58.124 --> 01:33:00.758
<i>This departure:
2100 hours.</i>

1511
01:33:02.292 --> 01:33:03.677
So we're shipped in
back to base.

1512
01:33:04.472 --> 01:33:05.898
This is central at stake.

1513
01:33:11.290 --> 01:33:13.522
Major Lennox, phone call.

1514
01:33:14.247 --> 01:33:16.157
Lennox, I'm with the kid.
The kid, you know?

1515
01:33:16.422 --> 01:33:17.463
One with the attitude break?

1516
01:33:17.464 --> 01:33:19.003
I need the truck.
The truck.

1517
01:33:19.038 --> 01:33:21.761
We got a possible resurrection
going on over here.

1518
01:33:21.795 --> 01:33:22.921
You're not gonna believe
where we are.

1519
01:33:22.922 --> 01:33:26.051
Code Tot,
as in King Tutankhamen,

1520
01:33:26.082 --> 01:33:27.752
back of a $1 bill.

1521
01:33:28.171 --> 01:33:33.006
Coordinates for air-drop,
29.5 North, 34.88 East.

1522
01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:34.708
Get it.
Write it down, write it.

1523
01:33:34.709 --> 01:33:35.711
Oh, my God.

1524
01:33:35.712 --> 01:33:37.198
I gotta go, okay.
I hate the cops.

1525
01:33:37.199 --> 01:33:38.911
W-Wait, who are you?

1526
01:33:39.997 --> 01:33:42.535
Wait, it's me.
Leo, me, Leo, Leo. Leo.

1527
01:33:42.638 --> 01:33:43.951
The cops are coming right now.
We need to go.

1528
01:33:47.019 --> 01:33:50.556
Coordinates
29.5 North, 34.88 East.

1529
01:33:50.557 --> 01:33:52.979
Tip of the Red Sea,
Gulf of Aqaba.

1530
01:33:53.462 --> 01:33:54.828
Egypt.

1531
01:33:54.997 --> 01:33:56.591
Are you serious?

1532
01:33:57.540 --> 01:33:58.620
Sir.

1533
01:34:02.904 --> 01:34:05.692
Even if we could figure out a way
to get big man over there.

1534
01:34:05.693 --> 01:34:08.320
How is this little kid's
supposed to bring him back to life?

1535
01:34:09.235 --> 01:34:10.570
I don't know.

1536
01:34:10.645 --> 01:34:12.053
But we gotta trust him.

1537
01:34:14.076 --> 01:34:15.491
Okay, let's go
over it again.

1538
01:34:15.492 --> 01:34:17.946
- When the dawn arise...
- When the dawn arise the dagger's tip,

1539
01:34:17.984 --> 01:34:20.062
- the three kings...
- ...will reveal the doorway.

1540
01:34:20.097 --> 01:34:21.839
That's what he said.
You know what that means?

1541
01:34:22.030 --> 01:34:23.748
- No, what does it mean?
- I have no idea.

1542
01:34:23.749 --> 01:34:25.622
Oh my God, oh my God.
Checkpoint, checkpoint.

1543
01:34:25.656 --> 01:34:27.198
I don't have
my passport.

1544
01:34:28.997 --> 01:34:33.492
Passport.
Idiota (Idiot)!

1545
01:34:37.906 --> 01:34:39.650
They have cams at top.

1546
01:34:41.332 --> 01:34:43.062
He's the one
that they want.

1547
01:34:43.831 --> 01:34:45.890
Alright, chill.
Let's be nice to them.

1548
01:34:46.504 --> 01:34:48.173
I can handle it.
These are my people.

1549
01:34:48.334 --> 01:34:50.235
- Yeah.
- I'm 136.

1550
01:34:52.730 --> 01:34:54.359
Oh great, a frickin' munchkin.

1551
01:34:54.394 --> 01:34:56.777
Oh, little people are mean.
Tell him he's tall.

1552
01:35:02.009 --> 01:35:05.829
- What do you want?
- I want to go to...

1553
01:35:05.905 --> 01:35:08.725
The Dagger's Tip, right?

1554
01:35:08.726 --> 01:35:11.366
Egypt, Jordan.
We wanna go there.

1555
01:35:11.367 --> 01:35:13.378
Me and my family.
This is my family.

1556
01:35:13.379 --> 01:35:15.424
- This is my son, my other son.
- Hi there.

1557
01:35:15.459 --> 01:35:16.312
My daughter.

1558
01:35:16.313 --> 01:35:18.464
We're tourists
from New York.

1559
01:35:18.586 --> 01:35:20.192
- New York?
- Yes. Yes.

1560
01:35:20.553 --> 01:35:21.694
50 kilometres.

1561
01:35:21.695 --> 01:35:23.092
We're going to get one
of your falafels, thank you!

1562
01:35:23.127 --> 01:35:24.121
Yeah,
thank you very much.

1563
01:35:24.122 --> 01:35:26.085
- New York.
- I know, I know you from somewhere.

1564
01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:28.163
No, we do not work
for the CIA.

1565
01:35:32.621 --> 01:35:36.134
<i>Decepticons,
voice location.</i>

1566
01:35:36.328 --> 01:35:37.820
<i>Detected.</i>

1567
01:35:38.643 --> 01:35:41.793
Starscream in pursuit.

1568
01:35:46.146 --> 01:35:49.132
Undercover, yo, you gotta blend in
with your surrounding.

1569
01:35:49.162 --> 01:35:51.404
You know, you gotta be
part of the landscape.

1570
01:35:59.690 --> 01:36:00.905
Awesome.

1571
01:36:01.473 --> 01:36:03.188
I think
aliens built that.

1572
01:36:03.308 --> 01:36:04.750
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1573
01:36:04.751 --> 01:36:06.228
Go, move it!
Move it.

1574
01:36:06.953 --> 01:36:07.944
- What?
- Hey, guard us.

1575
01:36:07.945 --> 01:36:09.280
Low-profile,
don't make a scene, okay?

1576
01:36:09.315 --> 01:36:10.720
Yeah, some of us
got work to do!

1577
01:36:11.049 --> 01:36:12.822
Dumb Autobots.

1578
01:36:15.744 --> 01:36:18.942
NEST, 0600 AM
Estimated time of detachment

1579
01:36:33.725 --> 01:36:35.768
Being my girlfriend
is hazardous to your health.

1580
01:36:37.517 --> 01:36:41.907
Yeah, well,
girls like dangerous boys.

1581
01:36:42.383 --> 01:36:43.732
- Really?
- Yeah.

1582
01:36:46.598 --> 01:36:48.227
Why don't you say it?

1583
01:36:48.971 --> 01:36:50.554
Ladies first.

1584
01:36:51.762 --> 01:36:54.075
Okay, so tonight,
you're gonna be a gentleman.

1585
01:36:54.593 --> 01:36:55.955
You're really chivalrous.

1586
01:36:56.325 --> 01:36:57.781
Why are you mad at me?

1587
01:36:57.867 --> 01:36:59.906
You know what?
Baby, I'm not...

1588
01:37:00.308 --> 01:37:01.794
I'm not mad.

1589
01:37:02.447 --> 01:37:06.862
You realise that I just flew 3,000 miles
to keep you from getting killed.

1590
01:37:07.022 --> 01:37:08.339
I know.

1591
01:37:11.473 --> 01:37:13.335
Who else could be
your girlfriend too?

1592
01:37:14.278 --> 01:37:16.330
Look at the things
that go through with me.

1593
01:37:17.588 --> 01:37:20.005
And now we're underneath
the moon and the stars

1594
01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:22.336
and the three most beautiful
pyramids on the planet

1595
01:37:22.377 --> 01:37:24.432
and you still can't even tell me
that you love me.

1596
01:37:28.113 --> 01:37:29.120
- What?
- Wait.

1597
01:37:29.121 --> 01:37:31.730
- Why do boys always change the subject?
- The moon and the stars...

1598
01:37:31.765 --> 01:37:33.528
- Sam...
- Come with me really quick.

1599
01:37:41.389 --> 01:37:43.461
Simmons, Leo,
wake up!

1600
01:37:46.775 --> 01:37:49.022
Listen, Astronomy class, page 47,
you remember the class?

1601
01:37:49.057 --> 01:37:51.653
No, no, I was only in college
for two days, you remember that?

1602
01:37:51.688 --> 01:37:53.665
- Yeah, well, get up. Up, up.
- What are you talking about?

1603
01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:00.442
Can you see
those three stars?

1604
01:38:00.443 --> 01:38:02.155
You see how the last one
touches the horizon?

1605
01:38:02.479 --> 01:38:03.848
That's Orion's belt.

1606
01:38:03.849 --> 01:38:06.131
It's also called the Three Kings
and the reason for that is

1607
01:38:06.166 --> 01:38:08.897
the three Egyptian kings who built
the pyramids in Giza built them

1608
01:38:08.933 --> 01:38:10.109
to mear those stars.

1609
01:38:10.110 --> 01:38:11.902
So it's like an aerial staring
straight in the face.

1610
01:38:11.934 --> 01:38:13.722
They all point due East
towards Jordan.

1611
01:38:14.053 --> 01:38:15.354
The mountains of Petra.

1612
01:38:28.554 --> 01:38:32.562
<i>We got a seatbelt malfunction.
We gotta have to divert...</i>

1613
01:38:32.563 --> 01:38:34.189
<i>Flight in lower,
prepare for bail-out.</i>

1614
01:38:34.335 --> 01:38:36.550
Bail-out, bail-out,
bail-out, bail-out?

1615
01:38:36.585 --> 01:38:38.735
Alright, team,
grab your shoots.

1616
01:38:38.770 --> 01:38:40.034
Bail-out?

1617
01:38:42.088 --> 01:38:43.727
Familiar with the standard
MC-4?

1618
01:38:43.962 --> 01:38:46.775
Of course not. I've never jumped out
of a publicly good airplane before.

1619
01:38:47.009 --> 01:38:48.380
Wait a minute,
is this really happening?

1620
01:38:48.381 --> 01:38:49.296
Yeah.

1621
01:38:51.424 --> 01:38:52.888
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1622
01:38:53.368 --> 01:38:54.772
You're behind this,
aren't you?

1623
01:38:54.976 --> 01:38:55.976
What are you talking about?

1624
01:38:55.977 --> 01:38:58.072
You heard the pilot.
These guys don't mess around.

1625
01:38:59.268 --> 01:39:02.276
This is standard procedure.
I'm just following orders to the letter.

1626
01:39:02.311 --> 01:39:04.019
Do you know
what you said?

1627
01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:06.950
You, just find the captain
and your career...

1628
01:39:12.530 --> 01:39:13.900
Wait, what was that?
What's that?

1629
01:39:13.901 --> 01:39:15.448
That's not good.

1630
01:39:15.464 --> 01:39:17.738
Come on.
Right this way, right this way!

1631
01:39:17.778 --> 01:39:19.000
I can't jump
out of an airplane.

1632
01:39:23.897 --> 01:39:26.169
Come here.
Come here.

1633
01:39:27.374 --> 01:39:30.175
Because I have to secure
the VIPs first.

1634
01:39:30.176 --> 01:39:32.521
Okay, I want you
to listen very carefully.

1635
01:39:32.522 --> 01:39:34.350
Remember as everything
that I say.

1636
01:39:34.591 --> 01:39:37.839
East to the GPS trackers, so
you can be found by search and rescue.

1637
01:39:42.058 --> 01:39:43.445
- Look, are you listening?
- I can't.

1638
01:39:44.738 --> 01:39:46.392
- Alright, alright.
- Alright.

1639
01:39:46.476 --> 01:39:48.325
When the plane that shoot
inflates into the air,

1640
01:39:48.326 --> 01:39:50.428
pull the pin
and open some air,

1641
01:39:50.488 --> 01:39:52.695
break your rack up,
lose your primary.

1642
01:39:52.887 --> 01:39:54.199
I want you
to pull the blue.

1643
01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:56.064
I need you to pull it
really hard.

1644
01:39:56.858 --> 01:39:59.432
Not right now.
We're on the plane, you dumbass!

1645
01:40:02.751 --> 01:40:03.865
Did he say goodbye?

1646
01:40:03.866 --> 01:40:05.577
No, he didn't even
say goodbye.

1647
01:40:06.099 --> 01:40:07.748
<i>General,
we're loaded and ready.</i>

1648
01:40:07.967 --> 01:40:10.826
<i>You give us the go, and we'll be ready
to press in five minutes.</i>

1649
01:40:11.043 --> 01:40:12.112
- Excellent.
- Sir,

1650
01:40:12.113 --> 01:40:13.882
you need to see this.
Now.

1651
01:40:16.479 --> 01:40:18.141
Have we checked
these coordinates?

1652
01:40:18.176 --> 01:40:19.586
Egypt, sir.
They're air-dropping in.

1653
01:40:19.606 --> 01:40:20.912
You gotta be kidding me.

1654
01:40:21.467 --> 01:40:22.812
He knows something.

1655
01:40:22.813 --> 01:40:25.679
We need to be ready to back him up,
if this thing goes hot.

1656
01:40:26.547 --> 01:40:27.796
Copy that.

1657
01:40:27.822 --> 01:40:29.981
CIA just got a hit
on the boy.

1658
01:40:31.034 --> 01:40:33.103
Hundred miles from the location
on that little map there.

1659
01:40:33.104 --> 01:40:34.409
It's getting hotter.

1660
01:40:38.591 --> 01:40:41.020
It's gotta be...
around here somewhere.

1661
01:41:21.689 --> 01:41:22.982
It's here somewhere,
guys.

1662
01:41:22.983 --> 01:41:24.236
Oh yeah, why?

1663
01:41:24.237 --> 01:41:25.990
'Cause we're trusting
Grandpa Blackbird

1664
01:41:26.025 --> 01:41:27.376
who doesn't even know
what planet he's on.

1665
01:41:27.446 --> 01:41:29.915
On his defense,
this is the biggest doorway

1666
01:41:29.950 --> 01:41:31.634
I've ever seen
in my entire life.

1667
01:41:32.339 --> 01:41:35.054
Okay. Well, that's great.
Let me do a quick search, alright?

1668
01:41:35.745 --> 01:41:36.569
Nope.

1669
01:41:36.570 --> 01:41:39.175
Ever questioned mind, guys, that
archaeologists have been here before.

1670
01:41:39.210 --> 01:41:40.169
There's nothing here.

1671
01:41:40.170 --> 01:41:42.500
You realise it's heart-break,
despair, kid.

1672
01:41:42.722 --> 01:41:44.876
Sometimes, you get
to the end of the rainbow

1673
01:41:44.916 --> 01:41:47.080
and the leprechauns went
and booby-trapped it.

1674
01:41:47.111 --> 01:41:48.786
I'm listening to you;
you live with your mother.

1675
01:41:50.523 --> 01:41:52.896
- It's not over.
- It is over. It's done.

1676
01:41:52.931 --> 01:41:54.543
Why are we still listening
to your little punk-ass?

1677
01:41:54.578 --> 01:41:56.678
I mean, what kind of dumbfucks
accept ding my rim?

1678
01:41:56.714 --> 01:41:58.716
Kill Megatron.
How about that?

1679
01:41:58.751 --> 01:42:00.362
Well, he doesn't get the job done,
you know, I mean,

1680
01:42:00.393 --> 01:42:02.286
- 'cause he's zapped, man.
- You scared?

1681
01:42:02.307 --> 01:42:04.172
Well, scared?
Scared of your ugly face.

1682
01:42:04.469 --> 01:42:07.052
I'm ugly?
Well, we twins, you stupid genius.

1683
01:42:14.055 --> 01:42:15.895
Guys!
Oh, hey!

1684
01:42:16.499 --> 01:42:17.673
You like
the way that feels?

1685
01:42:17.674 --> 01:42:19.282
- That ain't hurt.
- You got that, don't you?

1686
01:42:19.317 --> 01:42:20.605
I'm getting up...

1687
01:42:29.122 --> 01:42:30.799
Now that's rude.

1688
01:42:41.659 --> 01:42:43.969
Oh, my God!
The symbols.

1689
01:42:45.083 --> 01:42:46.710
Bee!
Shoot it.

1690
01:43:16.988 --> 01:43:17.934
Wow!

1691
01:43:17.935 --> 01:43:19.763
This is the part
which they found silicon.

1692
01:43:20.843 --> 01:43:22.419
The Tomb of the Primes.

1693
01:43:40.940 --> 01:43:42.415
The Matrix.

1694
01:44:06.068 --> 01:44:08.381
Thousands of years
turned to dust.

1695
01:44:09.054 --> 01:44:10.709
This isn't how
it's supposed to end.

1696
01:44:11.379 --> 01:44:12.796
Hear that?

1697
01:44:16.771 --> 01:44:19.519
US Air Force. C-17s.

1698
01:44:20.811 --> 01:44:23.339
You can't bring it back, Sam,
there's nothing left.

1699
01:44:23.593 --> 01:44:25.564
Look, look around you.

1700
01:44:25.823 --> 01:44:28.490
We didn't just go through everything
we went through for no reason at all.

1701
01:44:28.526 --> 01:44:29.929
They just haven't
end like this.

1702
01:44:29.945 --> 01:44:31.792
There is a reason
that we're here.

1703
01:44:31.827 --> 01:44:34.217
The voices and the symbols
in my head led us here...

1704
01:44:34.218 --> 01:44:35.940
for a purpose.

1705
01:44:41.353 --> 01:44:43.428
Everyone's after me
because of what I know.

1706
01:44:45.752 --> 01:44:48.829
And what I know,
is that this is going to work.

1707
01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:51.140
How do you know
it's going to work?

1708
01:44:51.175 --> 01:44:52.671
Because I believe it.

1709
01:45:03.179 --> 01:45:05.213
Best put me out
of this plane.

1710
01:45:15.841 --> 01:45:18.615
He's dropping the big one.
Sam!

1711
01:45:26.167 --> 01:45:28.292
You think you can bring him
back to life with that pixie dust?

1712
01:45:28.327 --> 01:45:30.071
Absolutely.
Let's go!

1713
01:45:39.877 --> 01:45:41.062
Go!

1714
01:45:42.235 --> 01:45:43.367
Move it!

1715
01:45:43.549 --> 01:45:44.872
Remember your friendly!

1716
01:45:55.318 --> 01:45:56.976
Cover Optimus!

1717
01:45:59.756 --> 01:46:01.802
Secure the village.
Get those cases down here.

1718
01:46:01.803 --> 01:46:03.886
Get snipers and Stingers
up high.

1719
01:46:04.401 --> 01:46:06.663
So he just dropped off
ten tonnes of dead robot

1720
01:46:06.683 --> 01:46:08.238
in the middle of nowhere.

1721
01:46:08.313 --> 01:46:10.113
Hope this little kid
know what he's doing.

1722
01:46:10.148 --> 01:46:11.613
Yeah, me too.

1723
01:46:17.080 --> 01:46:20.475
Got a visual!
Yellow tee, four klicks.

1724
01:46:23.618 --> 01:46:25.262
Hot-flare!

1725
01:46:27.330 --> 01:46:29.140
That's them right there.
You see the flare?

1726
01:46:29.189 --> 01:46:30.705
Right over there!
See it?

1727
01:46:31.542 --> 01:46:33.604
The boy has been found.

1728
01:46:41.064 --> 01:46:42.382
Sam!

1729
01:46:54.418 --> 01:46:55.917
Oh God, please God,

1730
01:46:55.946 --> 01:46:57.133
- please!
- Leo, stop freaking out.

1731
01:46:57.134 --> 01:46:59.428
- Just stop freaking out!
- Just drop this guy off, huh?

1732
01:46:59.463 --> 01:47:01.084
- Please let me live, just let me live.
- Stop freaking out!

1733
01:47:01.405 --> 01:47:02.950
Just stop screaming
right now. That's it.

1734
01:47:05.579 --> 01:47:07.508
Can't take that guy
anymore.

1735
01:47:29.729 --> 01:47:30.903
We gotta split up.

1736
01:47:30.904 --> 01:47:33.601
Bumblebee, you are the decoy.
You lead the Decepticons away, alright?

1737
01:47:33.926 --> 01:47:34.960
I'm gonna get Optimus.

1738
01:47:34.961 --> 01:47:36.986
I'll help throw their fire away.

1739
01:47:37.366 --> 01:47:38.877
You get to those soldiers.

1740
01:47:40.618 --> 01:47:42.092
I hope
that dust works, kid.

1741
01:47:42.522 --> 01:47:43.964
Thank you.

1742
01:47:47.477 --> 01:47:48.944
It's turning around.

1743
01:47:49.429 --> 01:47:50.770
It's coming back,
it's coming back.

1744
01:47:51.734 --> 01:47:52.943
It's up to me.

1745
01:47:52.944 --> 01:47:55.881
One man, alone, betrayed
by the country he loves,

1746
01:47:55.915 --> 01:47:58.380
now its last hope
in the final hour of need.

1747
01:47:58.381 --> 01:48:00.941
The pants are to be driven
like never before.

1748
01:48:00.942 --> 01:48:02.241
Under my skin.

1749
01:48:02.242 --> 01:48:04.076
Hey, hey, hey!
Don't go nowhere.

1750
01:48:04.111 --> 01:48:06.163
- Drive!
- You will never make it, kid.

1751
01:48:06.198 --> 01:48:07.841
Bravery will only get you
so far.

1752
01:48:07.877 --> 01:48:10.484
You tased me, okay?
You owe me.

1753
01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:11.730
- I'm go.
- Okay, okay.

1754
01:48:11.731 --> 01:48:13.052
That was a test.
You passed, alright?

1755
01:48:20.755 --> 01:48:22.971
Thing's got alien tattoos
all over.

1756
01:48:23.369 --> 01:48:25.105
That ain't Air Force.

1757
01:48:28.340 --> 01:48:29.722
What the hell was that?

1758
01:48:29.757 --> 01:48:31.498
- Eddy-1, copy.
- Anyone there?

1759
01:48:31.534 --> 01:48:32.244
Who's up?

1760
01:48:32.245 --> 01:48:33.668
- Copy.
- Radio's down.

1761
01:48:33.704 --> 01:48:35.139
It's dead.
Counter that.

1762
01:48:35.169 --> 01:48:36.714
EMP-burst.

1763
01:48:36.932 --> 01:48:39.841
Let's see how this day is going
in this godforsaken desert.

1764
01:48:41.830 --> 01:48:42.659
Yes, sir.

1765
01:48:42.660 --> 01:48:44.641
<i>Major Lennox told me
to pull the cord.</i>

1766
01:48:44.676 --> 01:48:45.762
I know, sir.

1767
01:48:45.763 --> 01:48:48.106
W-Which, what country
am I in right now?

1768
01:48:48.107 --> 01:48:49.463
United States.

1769
01:48:49.955 --> 01:48:53.646
No, no, not the United States.
I'm from the United States,

1770
01:48:53.686 --> 01:48:55.796
<i>I'm in the middle of nowhere,
surrounded by goats.</i>

1771
01:48:56.572 --> 01:48:59.233
Well, that was
our good friend, Galloway.

1772
01:48:59.234 --> 01:49:01.104
He's less than pleased.

1773
01:49:01.438 --> 01:49:04.077
How is it that
we can't reach our men,

1774
01:49:04.117 --> 01:49:09.861
but he can reach me
from some random Egyptian desert?

1775
01:49:13.643 --> 01:49:14.765
Nothing.

1776
01:49:15.122 --> 01:49:18.181
Mike, put an SOS, let the eye in the sky
know we need some help.

1777
01:49:18.216 --> 01:49:19.381
Yes, sir.

1778
01:49:20.803 --> 01:49:23.236
Pop some more flares
so that the kid can find us.

1779
01:49:30.343 --> 01:49:32.510
There he is.
We got a couple of miles.

1780
01:49:32.929 --> 01:49:37.452
Lennox's team has the latest
in quantum crypto gear.

1781
01:49:37.493 --> 01:49:43.429
Can somebody tell me why we can't
establish simple radio contact?

1782
01:49:43.430 --> 01:49:45.804
We're hailing them on every frequency
and mode in the book, sir.

1783
01:49:46.155 --> 01:49:47.549
Our satellites in the area
have gone blind.

1784
01:49:47.584 --> 01:49:48.708
We're working it, sir.

1785
01:49:48.709 --> 01:49:49.910
Dammit.

1786
01:49:49.911 --> 01:49:52.463
Something's not right,
it doesn't add up.

1787
01:49:52.498 --> 01:49:55.802
Contact the Jordanians, see what
their assets they've got in the area.

1788
01:49:55.803 --> 01:49:58.191
And get Egypt's
General Salaam,

1789
01:49:58.232 --> 01:50:02.335
ask him to clear some US
V over-flights in Egyptian airspace.

1790
01:50:02.370 --> 01:50:05.366
We need an assist
in confirming visuals now.

1791
01:50:05.604 --> 01:50:07.027
Scramble predators now.

1792
01:50:07.369 --> 01:50:08.820
B-1, rotate.

1793
01:50:20.743 --> 01:50:22.410
East on the mile
that way.

1794
01:50:28.314 --> 01:50:29.404
Come here.

1795
01:50:32.492 --> 01:50:33.794
This way.

1796
01:50:38.860 --> 01:50:42.299
- One man... alone...
- Stop saying that.

1797
01:50:42.334 --> 01:50:44.250
- betrayed by the country he loves.
- Oh my goodness,

1798
01:50:44.279 --> 01:50:46.169
I'm in the car, okay?
You're not alone.

1799
01:50:46.611 --> 01:50:48.402
Just relax,
you're looking nice well.

1800
01:50:57.590 --> 01:50:59.217
I-I don't think
he's still following us.

1801
01:51:00.684 --> 01:51:02.356
That's what you think.

1802
01:51:19.380 --> 01:51:23.033
Master, sorry to be
the bearer of bad news,

1803
01:51:23.068 --> 01:51:26.053
but the soldiers brought
the body of Prime.

1804
01:51:26.345 --> 01:51:28.625
The boy must have
the Matrix.

1805
01:51:29.006 --> 01:51:31.611
We cannot let him
reach Optimus.

1806
01:51:32.136 --> 01:51:33.969
Decepticons!

1807
01:51:34.132 --> 01:51:35.912
Begin our assault!

1808
01:51:36.798 --> 01:51:38.156
We got incoming!

1809
01:51:54.444 --> 01:51:56.608
We got a whole load of
flight coming our way!

1810
01:51:57.361 --> 01:51:59.242
- How many?
- We got 13 to count.

1811
01:51:59.698 --> 01:52:02.308
This ain't good.
This ain't good.

1812
01:52:10.424 --> 01:52:12.619
We 'bout to get
our asses whooped.

1813
01:52:15.455 --> 01:52:18.152
Alright, those Decepticons
are searching for Sam.

1814
01:52:19.851 --> 01:52:22.696
Whatever he has, he thinks
it'll bring Optimus back to life.

1815
01:52:22.731 --> 01:52:25.853
So our mission is to find him
and get him to Optimus.

1816
01:52:25.915 --> 01:52:27.752
Alright, we're gonna draw
fire from the left flag.

1817
01:52:27.814 --> 01:52:29.301
I need a scout team.

1818
01:52:29.672 --> 01:52:31.713
We'll walk through the middle
with Arcee and Ironhide.

1819
01:52:32.294 --> 01:52:33.822
Alright, when you see
the precious cargo,

1820
01:52:33.871 --> 01:52:36.801
I want you to pop green smoke
and come back to those pillars.

1821
01:52:36.841 --> 01:52:38.399
We'll have
the ambush set.

1822
01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:39.799
Alright, let's go,
move out!

1823
01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:40.936
- Move out!
- Move out!

1824
01:52:49.194 --> 01:52:51.367
Did you see that film
Gunfire Aero-Kay Karao?

1825
01:52:53.406 --> 01:52:56.521
- Casting Kirk Douglas.
- No, why?

1826
01:52:59.602 --> 01:53:01.008
Looks like we're right
in the middle of it.

1827
01:53:01.448 --> 01:53:02.766
Is that good?

1828
01:53:04.729 --> 01:53:06.095
Lot of people died.

1829
01:53:22.602 --> 01:53:25.264
- Oh, oh, oh...
- Hide!

1830
01:53:27.558 --> 01:53:29.195
Oh my God!

1831
01:53:50.853 --> 01:53:52.465
Sam, Sam.

1832
01:53:55.874 --> 01:53:57.331
Get down, get down.

1833
01:54:01.501 --> 01:54:02.828
Once, it's clear,
we'll run for Optimus

1834
01:54:02.829 --> 01:54:04.198
as fast we can, okay?

1835
01:54:06.034 --> 01:54:07.726
And what if
it doesn't work?

1836
01:54:08.374 --> 01:54:09.789
This will work.

1837
01:54:09.902 --> 01:54:11.731
- Yeah, but what if it doesn't?
- It's gonna work.

1838
01:54:12.354 --> 01:54:13.759
It'll work.

1839
01:56:01.009 --> 01:56:02.574
Radio shell.

1840
01:56:21.448 --> 01:56:22.786
We got a half a mile.

1841
01:56:22.787 --> 01:56:24.271
I don't think
the soldiers know we're here.

1842
01:56:27.065 --> 01:56:28.234
Fall back!

1843
01:56:28.341 --> 01:56:29.898
Ironhide, up for middle.

1844
01:56:30.237 --> 01:56:31.891
Ironhide, move it.

1845
01:56:32.241 --> 01:56:34.193
Go!
Go, go!

1846
01:56:45.524 --> 01:56:46.995
There's no way to go.
We're gonna die!

1847
01:56:46.996 --> 01:56:49.378
Listen, we're going out.
We're going out like men, understand?

1848
01:57:19.048 --> 01:57:21.155
- Oh.
- Look at this motherf...

1849
01:57:21.746 --> 01:57:23.740
Mean robots suck!

1850
01:57:36.344 --> 01:57:37.613
Get back!

1851
01:57:42.142 --> 01:57:43.552
Grab it!
Don't let go.

1852
01:57:43.729 --> 01:57:45.175
Hang in, man,
I got this.

1853
01:57:50.153 --> 01:57:51.831
I don't wanna die.

1854
01:57:53.577 --> 01:57:55.521
Careful grip, boy.
Careful grip.

1855
01:58:01.185 --> 01:58:03.708
He did.
He got so waste.

1856
01:58:04.051 --> 01:58:05.292
Who's your daddy
now, huh?

1857
01:58:05.293 --> 01:58:06.890
He got all these...

1858
01:58:06.891 --> 01:58:08.718
Well, the safe place
is right under it.

1859
01:58:09.006 --> 01:58:11.321
Run it.
Run for his feet!

1860
01:58:19.807 --> 01:58:23.198
You're never eating me.
I'm gonna bust your face up.

1861
01:58:31.815 --> 01:58:34.186
Nobody's tested me.
In your face!

1862
01:58:35.375 --> 01:58:37.021
Take five, Mudflap.

1863
01:58:37.835 --> 01:58:39.272
Oh my God!

1864
01:58:42.121 --> 01:58:43.970
Yeehaw!

1865
01:58:45.689 --> 01:58:47.538
Nobody messes
with the twins.

1866
01:58:50.560 --> 01:58:52.070
I got you.

1867
01:58:55.158 --> 01:58:57.487
Ow, man,
you shot me in the face!

1868
01:58:57.931 --> 01:59:00.188
- Stay under it!
- Yeah, stay under it.

1869
01:59:10.033 --> 01:59:11.857
Rampage, set up the trap.

1870
01:59:21.594 --> 01:59:22.581
Judy!

1871
01:59:27.822 --> 01:59:29.425
- Sam!
- What?

1872
01:59:29.460 --> 01:59:30.735
Sam!

1873
01:59:30.995 --> 01:59:32.568
Sam! Sam!

1874
01:59:37.262 --> 01:59:38.785
Sam!

1875
01:59:38.796 --> 01:59:40.193
- Sam.
- Dad!

1876
01:59:47.747 --> 01:59:49.264
Wait! Wait!

1877
01:59:50.587 --> 01:59:51.837
Please listen...

1878
01:59:52.524 --> 01:59:54.146
I want you to run!
Run!

1879
01:59:54.186 --> 01:59:55.185
- Dad, just stop!
- Get out of here.

1880
01:59:55.186 --> 01:59:56.722
- They don't want you, they want me.
- Just run!

1881
01:59:56.723 --> 01:59:58.143
Oh God, wait!

1882
01:59:58.228 --> 02:00:00.991
- Samuel Witwicky.
- Wait.

1883
02:00:02.960 --> 02:00:04.272
This is what you want.
You don't want 'em.

1884
02:00:04.725 --> 02:00:06.731
- Go! Go!
- Please, stop! Stop!

1885
02:00:06.732 --> 02:00:08.683
- Why don't you...
- Just get out of here!

1886
02:00:09.810 --> 02:00:11.206
Just don't move.

1887
02:00:11.266 --> 02:00:12.136
I know you.

1888
02:00:12.137 --> 02:00:13.836
Just go!
Just go!

1889
02:00:13.871 --> 02:00:15.293
And I know what,
you need me.

1890
02:00:16.239 --> 02:00:17.847
Because I know about
the Matrix.

1891
02:00:18.189 --> 02:00:19.795
- Don't do it. Sam, listen to me.
- Please, Dad.

1892
02:00:19.834 --> 02:00:20.826
They're gonna
kill us all anyway.

1893
02:00:20.827 --> 02:00:22.278
Hey, hey.
Look.

1894
02:00:22.279 --> 02:00:23.631
This is what you want.
I'm here.

1895
02:00:24.347 --> 02:00:26.072
Bumblebee!

1896
02:00:29.679 --> 02:00:30.928
Help!

1897
02:00:38.450 --> 02:00:40.374
Kill him, Bee.
Kill him.

1898
02:01:19.668 --> 02:01:21.384
Come on,
get in.

1899
02:01:35.068 --> 02:01:36.998
- Bee?
- Yeah.

1900
02:01:40.214 --> 02:01:43.403
Hey! I don't know what's going on,
but we gotta move.

1901
02:01:47.034 --> 02:01:48.763
- Run!
- There's gotta be a way out of here.

1902
02:01:54.141 --> 02:01:56.059
Buckle up, buckle up!
Get in here.

1903
02:01:58.309 --> 02:02:00.460
Bee! Bumblebee!

1904
02:02:01.175 --> 02:02:03.033
You get them
somewhere safe, alright?

1905
02:02:05.490 --> 02:02:06.825
You gotta get in the car.
You can be safe.

1906
02:02:06.865 --> 02:02:08.687
No, listen to my discussion.

1907
02:02:08.722 --> 02:02:10.111
- You're my son, alright?
- I know!

1908
02:02:10.112 --> 02:02:12.037
You're my son!
We'll all go together.

1909
02:02:12.077 --> 02:02:13.513
- Listen.
- We're all going together.

1910
02:02:13.548 --> 02:02:15.637
Dad, stop, okay?
Get in the car.

1911
02:02:15.672 --> 02:02:17.703
He's gonna get you to safety.
You don't, you run.

1912
02:02:17.739 --> 02:02:19.955
You don't stop, you don't hide, you run.
You hear what I'm saying?

1913
02:02:20.198 --> 02:02:21.826
Okay?
I'll find you when you're safe.

1914
02:02:21.861 --> 02:02:23.323
- No.
- You gotta let me go, Dad.

1915
02:02:23.358 --> 02:02:24.717
You'll have
to let me go.

1916
02:02:25.350 --> 02:02:26.851
- You have to.
- Ron.

1917
02:02:29.363 --> 02:02:31.957
Ron, Ron!
Let him go.

1918
02:02:33.850 --> 02:02:35.492
Just come back!

1919
02:02:35.708 --> 02:02:37.018
- Come on!
- Come on!

1920
02:02:37.019 --> 02:02:38.196
Mikaela, Mikaela!

1921
02:02:38.197 --> 02:02:39.966
- Go with my parents.
- I'm not gonna go with them.

1922
02:02:58.045 --> 02:03:00.784
- We got Jordanians!
- We got help!

1923
02:03:24.911 --> 02:03:26.366
You okay, soldier?

1924
02:03:26.544 --> 02:03:27.924
We're gonna help you,
soldier.

1925
02:03:28.205 --> 02:03:30.013
Let's get being moon
and clear the birds!

1926
02:03:30.048 --> 02:03:31.562
Stay still, stay still.
Don't move.

1927
02:03:32.165 --> 02:03:33.404
You alright, young man?

1928
02:03:33.405 --> 02:03:35.032
- You have a radio?
- Yes.

1929
02:03:35.878 --> 02:03:38.041
Hey kid,
it's been nice knowing you.

1930
02:03:38.223 --> 02:03:40.114
Remember what I did
for my country.

1931
02:03:41.551 --> 02:03:43.031
This is my moment.

1932
02:03:44.232 --> 02:03:45.969
You're crazy!

1933
02:03:47.445 --> 02:03:49.291
ETA to station,
two minutes.

1934
02:03:49.326 --> 02:03:51.187
- Put it on the main screen.
- Sir, yes, sir.

1935
02:03:51.443 --> 02:03:52.975
Predator's air-one.

1936
02:04:02.900 --> 02:04:04.399
Oh shit, it's a trick.

1937
02:04:04.450 --> 02:04:06.901
Commence Operation Firestorm.
Send everyone.

1938
02:04:06.936 --> 02:04:09.762
- Get those boys out of the ground.
- This is 101 in strike packages.

1939
02:04:09.831 --> 02:04:11.443
Fast course river.
Execute lightly.

1940
02:04:31.769 --> 02:04:33.878
- Spotted Sam.
- Hurry, don't slow up!

1941
02:04:34.917 --> 02:04:36.663
Ironhide!

1942
02:04:36.930 --> 02:04:39.126
Follow us to the pillars.
We'll take you to Optimus.

1943
02:04:39.262 --> 02:04:40.246
Look out!

1944
02:04:42.967 --> 02:04:45.050
Sam, get to the pillars!

1945
02:04:46.325 --> 02:04:47.550
Let's go.

1946
02:04:51.001 --> 02:04:54.437
Oh God, this is it. The pyramids built
right over the machine.

1947
02:04:54.473 --> 02:04:55.943
They turn
that machine on...

1948
02:04:57.641 --> 02:04:59.187
no more Sun.

1949
02:05:01.319 --> 02:05:02.713
Not on my watch.

1950
02:05:02.841 --> 02:05:05.882
Not on my watch.

1951
02:05:16.691 --> 02:05:19.619
<i>- USS Stennis, identify.
- Hey, where the hell are you?</i>

1952
02:05:19.807 --> 02:05:20.680
<i>What, you're on
a weather channel?</i>

1953
02:05:20.681 --> 02:05:22.743
<i>Sports center,
high-dreaming TV or something?</i>

1954
02:05:22.773 --> 02:05:24.454
We get a pretty hundred
satellites up there.

1955
02:05:24.544 --> 02:05:26.937
Where the hell
are all our men?

1956
02:05:27.146 --> 02:05:28.716
Identify yourself.

1957
02:05:28.976 --> 02:05:30.313
What is your name, sailor?

1958
02:05:30.758 --> 02:05:35.923
Wilder, Captain of the
USS John C. Stennis Aircraft Carrier.

1959
02:05:37.049 --> 02:05:38.572
Okay, Captain Wilder,

1960
02:05:38.607 --> 02:05:41.106
<i>this is Agent Seymour Simmons,
head of the Sector Seven.</i>

1961
02:05:41.217 --> 02:05:43.591
<i>There is a mother of
all non-biologicals</i>

1962
02:05:43.626 --> 02:05:45.420
<i>getting ready
to blow up our Sun.</i>

1963
02:05:45.713 --> 02:05:47.310
You want to have fooled down
about my lack of clearance,

1964
02:05:47.345 --> 02:05:49.590
or you want to help
save a gazillion lives?

1965
02:05:50.225 --> 02:05:52.609
Alright, Agent Simmons.
I'm listening.

1966
02:05:59.821 --> 02:06:01.158
Five klicks.

1967
02:06:01.457 --> 02:06:02.612
<i>West of the gulf.</i>

1968
02:06:02.613 --> 02:06:05.549
<i>We got ourselves a dalion
remodelling a pyramid.</i>

1969
02:06:06.032 --> 02:06:09.037
I want hopes of prototype weapon
pull a rail gun.

1970
02:06:10.400 --> 02:06:11.930
That's classified.

1971
02:06:11.931 --> 02:06:15.799
Don't talk to me
about classified, alright?

1972
02:06:15.834 --> 02:06:17.570
Now if you've got
a battleship in the gulf

1973
02:06:18.484 --> 02:06:21.371
you tell him to ready
that weapon!

1974
02:06:22.384 --> 02:06:24.806
Contact Destroyer,
USS Kit.

1975
02:06:27.147 --> 02:06:28.880
This way!
Move it!

1976
02:06:30.852 --> 02:06:32.621
What you need is there.

1977
02:06:33.094 --> 02:06:34.786
Let's go! Go!

1978
02:06:38.607 --> 02:06:40.131
Give me your talk.
Come on.

1979
02:06:40.166 --> 02:06:41.317
Epps!

1980
02:06:45.709 --> 02:06:47.499
Right now,
we need air support.

1981
02:06:48.194 --> 02:06:49.929
That ship's in contact.
20 miles...

1982
02:06:49.930 --> 02:06:52.100
Grid on contact.
Proceed 88, Alpha Sierra.

1983
02:06:56.083 --> 02:06:59.170
USS Stenin 0-9-0,
you are approved to drop a 2,000...

1984
02:07:07.353 --> 02:07:08.636
- What you got?
- A detonator, sir.

1985
02:07:08.637 --> 02:07:10.674
They're 600 minutes away and
they're heading right for the pillars.

1986
02:07:10.709 --> 02:07:11.879
Alright.

1987
02:07:12.120 --> 02:07:13.519
Precious cargo's coming.

1988
02:07:13.799 --> 02:07:15.105
Move!

1989
02:07:41.191 --> 02:07:42.372
Sam!

1990
02:07:42.373 --> 02:07:44.040
Spotted Sam.

1991
02:08:15.301 --> 02:08:16.541
Come on!

1992
02:08:16.542 --> 02:08:19.055
2-2, covering fire.
Two civilians, twelve o'clock.

1993
02:08:27.347 --> 02:08:28.844
Cover for us.

1994
02:08:35.375 --> 02:08:38.355
Okay, air strike.
We'll rescue the civilians.

1995
02:08:57.901 --> 02:08:59.770
Come on. Get up!

1996
02:09:00.204 --> 02:09:01.188
Come on!

1997
02:09:01.994 --> 02:09:03.187
Get in here.

1998
02:09:03.511 --> 02:09:04.953
Oh look
who showed up.

1999
02:09:04.954 --> 02:09:07.049
You better have a good reason
for us to be here.

2000
02:09:07.080 --> 02:09:08.202
Where's Optimus?

2001
02:09:08.203 --> 02:09:10.043
He's right over there,
across the courtyard.

2002
02:09:11.159 --> 02:09:12.074
I got to get to him
right now.

2003
02:09:12.075 --> 02:09:13.495
No, we got
an air strike coming.

2004
02:09:13.496 --> 02:09:14.974
I have to get to him
right now.

2005
02:09:17.059 --> 02:09:18.527
Come here,
b-back.

2006
02:09:28.580 --> 02:09:30.159
Incoming!

2007
02:09:34.147 --> 02:09:37.095
Behold to the only
Jetfire!

2008
02:09:38.289 --> 02:09:41.952
Now let me show you
how we brought them pain in my day.

2009
02:10:01.947 --> 02:10:03.333
Too old
for this crap.

2010
02:10:03.368 --> 02:10:04.388
Keep going.

2011
02:10:04.389 --> 02:10:05.742
15 minutes of fighting.

2012
02:10:25.904 --> 02:10:29.721
I am directly below
the enemy's scrotum.

2013
02:10:30.476 --> 02:10:32.686
<i>25.7 metres
above sea level,</i>

2014
02:10:32.738 --> 02:10:33.912
<i>29.32 North.</i>

2015
02:10:33.913 --> 02:10:36.100
- Field track, 5-2, 0500 o'clock.
- Target acquired.

2016
02:10:36.171 --> 02:10:37.474
Killing track two.

2017
02:10:37.475 --> 02:10:39.299
<i>Lock. Fire.</i>

2018
02:10:54.307 --> 02:10:56.271
Yeah! Yeah!

2019
02:10:56.305 --> 02:10:58.239
<i>B-1, stand on my target.
30 seconds...</i>

2020
02:11:00.030 --> 02:11:02.212
We're gonna make a break
for the beast on my command, okay?

2021
02:11:02.263 --> 02:11:04.136
You guys stick with me,
you understand?

2022
02:11:04.171 --> 02:11:05.946
You stay on my ass.

2023
02:11:07.033 --> 02:11:08.892
Hope these F-16s
got good aim.

2024
02:11:08.893 --> 02:11:10.216
Yeah, why is that?

2025
02:11:10.217 --> 02:11:11.849
I told them
to hit the orange smoke.

2026
02:11:13.682 --> 02:11:15.324
You mean
that orange smoke?

2027
02:11:15.325 --> 02:11:17.095
It wasn't my best toss,
okay?

2028
02:11:18.800 --> 02:11:20.331
- Run!
- Run!

2029
02:11:28.811 --> 02:11:30.339
Incoming!

2030
02:11:33.470 --> 02:11:34.566
Come on.

2031
02:12:08.157 --> 02:12:09.587
Die!

2032
02:12:16.068 --> 02:12:17.419
Sam!

2033
02:12:33.499 --> 02:12:35.317
Hold your fire!

2034
02:12:37.558 --> 02:12:38.681
Sam!

2035
02:12:40.262 --> 02:12:42.564
Get out!
Get me an EVAC.

2036
02:12:44.597 --> 02:12:46.747
Can't you do something?

2037
02:13:21.866 --> 02:13:23.931
- Sam! Sam...
- Sam!

2038
02:13:30.610 --> 02:13:33.128
Come on, we got to move.
We got to move! Come on!

2039
02:13:38.247 --> 02:13:39.702
Sammy!

2040
02:13:43.051 --> 02:13:46.492
Clear! Take a shot.
Clear! Take a shot.

2041
02:13:46.584 --> 02:13:48.242
One, two, three.

2042
02:13:50.864 --> 02:13:51.988
Do it again.

2043
02:13:57.308 --> 02:13:59.152
Sam!

2044
02:14:00.992 --> 02:14:06.139
Okay, listen to my voice.
I love you and I need you.

2045
02:14:06.974 --> 02:14:12.334
Please, please come back to me.
Sam, please! I love you!

2046
02:14:24.105 --> 02:14:25.930
Am I dead?

2047
02:14:26.722 --> 02:14:31.031
We have been watching you.
A long, long time.

2048
02:14:33.324 --> 02:14:35.379
You have fought
for Optimus,

2049
02:14:35.552 --> 02:14:40.042
our last descendant,
with courage and with sacrifice.

2050
02:14:40.077 --> 02:14:42.703
The virtues of a leader.

2051
02:14:43.159 --> 02:14:46.273
A leader
worthy of our secret.

2052
02:14:46.584 --> 02:14:49.480
The Matrix of Leadership
is not found.

2053
02:14:50.003 --> 02:14:51.421
It is earned.

2054
02:14:52.517 --> 02:14:54.799
Return now to Optimus,

2055
02:14:55.432 --> 02:14:57.674
merge the Matrix
with his Spark.

2056
02:14:58.367 --> 02:15:03.064
It is, and always has been,
your destiny.

2057
02:15:07.869 --> 02:15:09.355
Sam.

2058
02:15:15.209 --> 02:15:16.546
I love you.

2059
02:15:55.431 --> 02:15:58.340
Boy, you returned
for me.

2060
02:15:59.789 --> 02:16:01.804
A living Prime!

2061
02:16:03.332 --> 02:16:05.772
I don't believe it.

2062
02:16:15.956 --> 02:16:18.356
My Matrix.

2063
02:16:23.834 --> 02:16:25.135
Get up, get up,
get up, get up.

2064
02:16:26.354 --> 02:16:28.123
Get up, Prime!

2065
02:16:29.415 --> 02:16:32.918
- Oh, no.
- He's turned on the machine.

2066
02:16:33.724 --> 02:16:35.446
You gotta stop him.
Get up!

2067
02:16:35.767 --> 02:16:37.321
Optimus!

2068
02:16:39.405 --> 02:16:41.881
Fallen, my master.

2069
02:16:42.053 --> 02:16:46.385
My brothers could not
stop me from this.

2070
02:16:47.400 --> 02:16:51.953
- Yes.
- Now I claim your sun.

2071
02:16:54.817 --> 02:16:56.486
Enemy target,
top of pyramid.

2072
02:16:56.487 --> 02:16:58.640
Engage,
engage, engage.

2073
02:17:04.009 --> 02:17:06.930
In moments,
we'll be at siren strength.

2074
02:17:22.744 --> 02:17:27.199
I never did a thing
worth doing until now.

2075
02:17:27.882 --> 02:17:30.662
Optimus,
take my parts.

2076
02:17:30.873 --> 02:17:33.780
And you'll have a power
you've never known.

2077
02:17:34.697 --> 02:17:36.872
Fulfill your destiny.

2078
02:17:42.913 --> 02:17:45.168
Jolt, electrify!

2079
02:18:05.760 --> 02:18:07.411
Let's roll.

2080
02:18:09.875 --> 02:18:11.726
Fire. Take it off
to the pyramid!

2081
02:18:23.789 --> 02:18:27.433
This planet
will be dark forever.

2082
02:18:49.793 --> 02:18:52.037
Die
like your brother.

2083
02:18:52.642 --> 02:18:54.955
They were
your brothers too.

2084
02:19:23.598 --> 02:19:25.882
First gra...

2085
02:19:38.786 --> 02:19:40.847
You picked
the wrong planet!

2086
02:19:43.787 --> 02:19:45.782
Give me your face.

2087
02:19:54.256 --> 02:19:58.389
I rise.
You fall.

2088
02:20:00.488 --> 02:20:03.683
No. No.

2089
02:20:05.170 --> 02:20:09.916
Not to call you a coward, Master,
but sometimes,

2090
02:20:09.917 --> 02:20:13.638
cowards do survive.

2091
02:20:14.170 --> 02:20:16.107
This isn't over.

2092
02:20:43.568 --> 02:20:46.395
You took all of this for you
to tell me that you love me.

2093
02:20:48.115 --> 02:20:49.586
You said it first.

2094
02:21:41.026 --> 02:21:43.443
Thank you, Sam,
for saving my life.

2095
02:21:44.902 --> 02:21:45.954
You're welcome.

2096
02:21:46.932 --> 02:21:48.666
Thank you
for believing in me.

2097
02:21:53.389 --> 02:21:58.035
<i>Our races united by a history
long forgotten.</i>

2098
02:21:58.036 --> 02:22:01.342
<i>And a future
we shall face together.</i>

2099
02:22:02.066 --> 02:22:06.328
<i>I am Optimus Prime,
and I send this message</i>

2100
02:22:06.362 --> 02:22:09.604
<i>so that our past
will always be remembered.</i>

2101
02:22:09.605 --> 02:22:13.518
<i>For in those memories,
we live on.</i>
