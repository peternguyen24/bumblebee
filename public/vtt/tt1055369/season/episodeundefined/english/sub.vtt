183
00:13:13.554 --> 00:13:15.529
- this hard?
- C-Can you just stop?

184
00:13:15.764 --> 00:13:17.163
- Yeah, okay, I'll stop.
- Just wait...

185
00:13:17.198 --> 00:13:18.683
- You carry this shit.
- I'll...I'll...

186

- Wow!
- You know what?

187
00:13:29.923 --> 00:13:31.483
I don't wanna go
anywhere with you.

188
00:13:31.518 --> 00:13:32.529
I don't wanna go
to France with you.

189
00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:34.217
I don't wanna go
around the corner with you.

190
00:13:34.252 --> 00:13:35.561
- Alright, fine.
- I'm just going back inside.

191
00:13:35.596 --> 00:13:37.357
I'll call you from Paris.

192

- It's the whole kitchen!

My house is on fire!

- Come here.

211
00:15:13.579 --> 00:15:15.727

- Yes, Mom.

- A word with you.
- Yeah.

215
00:15:20.044 --> 00:15:20.849
- Hi, Mikaela.
- Hi.

216
00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:22.175
- I have a bald spot.
- Oh.

217
00:15:22.176 --> 00:15:24.410
- An old furnace, I think.
- Become a waffle iron.

Just consider this the official start
of a remodel, okay?

224
00:15:38.183 --> 00:15:40.213
Fine. If the government's paying,
I want a pool...

225
00:15:40.293 --> 00:15:41.464
- and a hot tub.
- Fine. Okay.

226
00:15:41.465 --> 00:15:44.175

I wanna wait outside,
okay?

234
00:16:07.572 --> 00:16:08.992
I wanted to tell you
about this earlier.

235
00:16:09.027 --> 00:16:10.502
It's just that...
You know,

236
00:16:10.537 --> 00:16:11.533
Here's the thing.

237
00:16:11.634 --> 00:16:13.153
Freshmen aren't allowed
to have cars.

238
00:16:13.681 --> 00:16:16.643
I know, and if it was up to me,
I'd take you with me, but it's not, Bee.

239
00:16:16.808 --> 00:16:18.079
Look, you're an Autobot.

240
00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.735
You shouldn't be living
in my dad's garage.

241
00:16:19.758 --> 00:16:21.319
I mean,
you're suffocating in here.

242
00:16:21.705 --> 00:16:23.125
You deserve
better than this.

243
00:16:23.889 --> 00:16:25.141
This is hard enough, man,

244
00:16:25.142 --> 00:16:26.968
don't make it harder.
Can you just look at me, please?

245
00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:30.579
Come on, big guy.

246
00:16:31.213 --> 00:16:34.352
Look, the guardian thing is done, okay?
You did your job.

247
00:16:34.454 --> 00:16:35.761
Look, I'm safe now.

248

Optimus Prime and the others.

249

to be normal, Bee.

That's why
I'm going to college.

251
00:16:41.933 --> 00:16:43.327
I can't do that
with you.

252
00:16:45.089 --> 00:16:47.178
It's not the last time
I'm gonna see you, you know, Bee.

253
00:16:47.324 --> 00:16:50.373
Come on, don't do that. Bee.
You're killing me, Bee.

254
00:16:52.615 --> 00:16:54.079
But you'll always be
my first car.

255
00:16:56.966 --> 00:16:58.492

00:17:10.588 --> 00:17:12.143
- What?
- It's...I'm okay.

260
00:17:12.178 --> 00:17:13.536
Well, look.

261
00:17:13.879 --> 00:17:15.064

you can make it

262
00:17:15.065 --> 00:17:16.857
through those East Coast

263
00:17:16.893 --> 00:17:18.632
You're like the best thing
that ever happened to me.

264
00:17:19.089 --> 00:17:20.596
And?

265
00:17:20.597 --> 00:17:24.102
- And I'll do anything for you.
- And?

266
00:17:24.181 --> 00:17:27.026
- I think Sam's about to say the L word.
- Let's go, kiddo.

267
00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.752
Nice timing, Dad.

268
00:17:28.753 --> 00:17:30.863
I... adore you.

269
00:17:32.065 --> 00:17:33.976
That's not the word that
I wanna hear really now.

270
00:17:34.011 --> 00:17:35.658
What are you talking about?
It's the same word as the other word.

271
00:17:35.659 --> 00:17:37.672
- It's not the same word.
- Look, if I said the other word now,

272
00:17:37.708 --> 00:17:39.083
you forced me to say
won't mean anything.

273
00:17:39.118 --> 00:17:40.091
Plus, you haven't
said it either.

274
00:17:40.092 --> 00:17:41.643
So don't get mad at me
for not saying it.

275
00:17:41.662 --> 00:17:42.363
Yeah,
but I haven't said it

276
00:17:42.364 --> 00:17:44.134
because guys always run
when you say it first.

277
00:17:44.169 --> 00:17:45.223
Yeah, well,
so do girls.

278
00:17:45.224 --> 00:17:46.965
Especially,
girls like you with options.

279
00:17:48.006 --> 00:17:51.051
So this is all part
of your elaborate plan

280
00:17:51.086 --> 00:17:52.719

281
00:17:52.826 --> 00:17:54.267
Can be.

Ain't those working?

283
00:17:56.734 --> 00:17:58.322

but not your advancements
in weaponry.

345
00:22:39.221 --> 00:22:42.842
We've witnessed
your human capacity for war.

346
00:22:43.094 --> 00:22:46.707
It would absolutely
bring more harm than good.

347
00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:49.794
But who are you
to judge what's best for us?

348
00:22:49.795 --> 00:22:51.956
With all due respect,
we've been fighting side-by-side

349
00:22:51.991 --> 00:22:53.489
in the field
for two years.

350
00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:56.654
We've shared blood, sweat
and precious metal together.

351
00:22:57.021 --> 00:22:59.713
Soldier, you're paid to shoot;
not talk.

352
00:22:59.748 --> 00:23:01.372
Don't tell me.

353
00:23:01.373 --> 00:23:02.694
And the, uh...

354
00:23:02.784 --> 00:23:04.756
- The newest members of your team...
- Easy...

355
00:23:05.088 --> 00:23:08.445
I understand they arrived here
after you sent a message into space.

356
00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.465
An open invitation
to come to Earth,

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:12.164
<i>embedded by no one

358
00:23:12.204 --> 00:23:14.330
Let me stop you
right there, Mr. Galloway.

359
00:23:14.365 --> 00:23:15.884
It was bedded
right here.

360
00:23:15.945 --> 00:23:19.936
<i>And in my experience, the judgement
of both Major Lennox and his team,</i>

361
00:23:19.971 --> 00:23:23.006
has always been
above reproach.

362
00:23:23.007 --> 00:23:25.846
<i>Well be that as it may, General,
it is the position of the President</i>

363
00:23:25.881 --> 00:23:27.922
<i>that when our national security
is at stake,</i>

364
00:23:29.059 --> 00:23:31.538
<i>no one
is above reproach.</i>

365
00:23:32.172 --> 00:23:34.723
Now, what do
we know so far?

366
00:23:35.367 --> 00:23:37.327
We know
that the enemy leader,

367
00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:41.123
<i>classified NBE-1,
AKA Megatron,</i>

368
00:23:41.514 --> 00:23:42.834
<i>is resting in peace</i>

369
00:23:42.869 --> 00:23:44.871
<i>at the bottom
of the Laurentian Abyss,</i>

370
00:23:44.906 --> 00:23:47.083
<i>surrounded by
societs detection nets</i>

371
00:23:47.123 --> 00:23:49.494
<i>and a full-time
submarine surveillance.</i>

372
00:23:49.565 --> 00:23:50.712
We also know that

373
00:23:50.713 --> 00:23:53.934
<i>the only remaining piece
of your alien All-Spark</i>

374
00:23:53.969 --> 00:23:56.009
<i>is locked in
an electromagnetic vault,</i>

375
00:23:56.044 --> 00:23:59.588
<i>here on one of the most secure
naval bases in the world.</i>

376
00:24:00.662 --> 00:24:04.093
Decepticons,
we have located the shard.

377
00:24:04.128 --> 00:24:05.528
<i>And since no one...</i>

378
00:24:05.799 --> 00:24:09.777
can seem to tell me
what the enemy is now after,

379
00:24:10.108 --> 00:24:12.971
well, there...there's only
one clear conclusion:

380
00:24:12.972 --> 00:24:16.219
You.
The Autobots.

381
00:24:16.571 --> 00:24:19.148
They're here to hunt you.

382
00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:22.109
What's there to hunt for
on Earth besides that?

383
00:24:22.144 --> 00:24:24.760
"The Fallen...
shall rise again"?

384
00:24:25.003 --> 00:24:26.578
Sounds to me like
something's coming.

385
00:24:27.365 --> 00:24:30.331
So let me ask
if we ultimately conclude

386
00:24:30.381 --> 00:24:32.217
that our national security
is best served

387
00:24:32.258 --> 00:24:36.169
by denying you further asylum
on our planet,

388
00:24:37.736 --> 00:24:40.732
will you leave peacefully?

389
00:24:41.039 --> 00:24:42.540
Freedom is your right.

390
00:24:42.912 --> 00:24:45.752
If you make that request,
we will honor it.

391
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.235
But before your president decides,
please ask him this.

392
00:24:52.619 --> 00:24:57.228
What if we leave
and you're wrong?

393
00:25:04.791 --> 00:25:06.416
That's a good question.

394
00:25:09.681 --> 00:25:11.002
Oh, my God,

395
00:25:11.037 --> 00:25:13.341
just look at this place!

396
00:25:14.175 --> 00:25:16.683
I feel smarter already.

397
00:25:17.216 --> 00:25:18.871
Ron, can you smell it?

398
00:25:19.334 --> 00:25:21.463
Yes, smells
like $40,000 a year.

399
00:25:21.522 --> 00:25:23.174
Okay, cheapo.

400
00:25:23.876 --> 00:25:26.059
Go ahead, we'll, uh...
We'll get your stuff.

401
00:25:26.094 --> 00:25:27.434
Just go ahead
and check out your room.

I'm Leo.

Hey.

406

Uh, sorry, I already set up the crib.
Do you want this side or that side?

407
00:25:46.321 --> 00:25:48.060
- That side.
- I already chose that side.

408
00:25:50.623 --> 00:25:52.723
You know what this is?
This is the awkward moment.

409
00:25:53.418 --> 00:25:55.404
Yeah, so you're trying to see
if I'm a normal guy.

410
00:25:55.434 --> 00:25:56.559
I'm trying to see
if you're a normal guy,

bad news in Shanghai.

Post it, baby. Go, go, go!
FTJ, FTJ!

- It's clean.
- What's FTJ?

00:26:41.871 --> 00:26:44.224
- Fuel the Jet, Fuel the Jet.
- FTJ, FTJ.

00:26:48.424 --> 00:26:50.530
- This is it. Did you see that?
- Wow. Okay, this half of Shanghai

437
00:26:50.561 --> 00:26:51.999

when China says gas leak.

438
00:26:52.034 --> 00:26:53.336
Don't believe the hype, bro.

439
00:26:54.422 --> 00:26:57.722
Just like the alien robots in LA
two years ago that everyone covered up.

440
00:26:58.195 --> 00:27:00.073
Yeah, I saw these robots
and they did this, like,

441
00:27:00.108 --> 00:27:02.469
firing thing and they came down
and twisted this woman

442
00:27:02.505 --> 00:27:03.830
- and she was like...
- Looks fake to me.

443
00:27:03.849 --> 00:27:06.895
Dude, it's not fake.
The Internet's pure true.

444
00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:08.949
- Neither does it lie.
- It looks fake.

445
00:27:08.984 --> 00:27:11.026
No, man, I've seen them.
They are like these, uh, robots...

446
00:27:11.904 --> 00:27:14.738
Look, look, look, it's fake.
Anybody can do on any computer, okay?

447
00:27:14.773 --> 00:27:16.379
And I wasn't, uh... there.

448
00:27:16.812 --> 00:27:18.291
So I can't comment
or speculate.

449
00:27:18.326 --> 00:27:20.254
- Oh, no.
- "Comment and speculate"?

450
00:27:20.289 --> 00:27:21.606
We're supposed
to go habitate?

451
00:27:21.646 --> 00:27:24.620
No, listen, okay.
Don't be sucking the sack, bro.

452
00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:26.349
- Whose sack?
- Look, the ball sack.

453
00:27:26.497 --> 00:27:29.596
- Dude, what kind of tool are you?
- Mainstream media sack.

454
00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:30.982
They're lying to us,
alright.

455
00:27:31.023 --> 00:27:33.136
- It's aliens, man.
- Okay, okay.

456
00:27:33.487 --> 00:27:34.805
Follow me.

457
00:27:34.806 --> 00:27:38.005
Uh-oh. Uh, Leo.
Bad news, we just got scooped.

458
00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:39.416

on GeoBoard.

By the way,
I read your file.

464
00:27:50.242 --> 00:27:52.765
I'll pour, you'll pour...
We're gonna fix that, alright?

465
00:27:52.896 --> 00:27:54.435
You work for me, now.

466
00:27:55.965 --> 00:27:57.421
I work for you now?

467
00:27:57.674 --> 00:27:59.119
That's incredible.
It's first day of college,

468
00:27:59.154 --> 00:28:01.186
I got a career,
a dinky internet firm,

469
00:28:01.218 --> 00:28:04.279
with a boss who is made up
of just pure champion stuff.

470
00:28:04.314 --> 00:28:06.321
You're mocking
my life's work, Samuel? Huh?

471
00:28:06.402 --> 00:28:07.782
That's your one warning
patrolling, dude.

472
00:28:07.812 --> 00:28:09.828
Don't make me that fast....
'cause I'll do it.

473
00:28:09.863 --> 00:28:12.269
Hey alright, listen. It's getting
a little intense in my room.

474
00:28:12.304 --> 00:28:14.398
- Can I switch now?
- Oh, sad face, 3-12.

475
00:28:14.438 --> 00:28:17.273
No switching, no treating.
Let's turn that upside-down, okay?

476
00:28:17.651 --> 00:28:19.040
- Oh, here we go.
- Hey, hi.

477
00:28:19.075 --> 00:28:21.153
It's just like Hogwarts.
Hi!

478
00:28:21.188 --> 00:28:22.984
Is this co-ed?
This is a co-ed dorm.

479
00:28:23.019 --> 00:28:24.474
Do you guys want
to meet my roommates?

480
00:28:24.509 --> 00:28:26.032
- Yeah.
- 'Cause they're real swell guys.

481
00:28:26.033 --> 00:28:27.169
- Here is Leo.
- We're the Witwicky.

482
00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:28.594
- I'm Leo.
- I'm Judy.

483
00:28:28.634 --> 00:28:30.496

You really do.

484
00:28:30.531 --> 00:28:31.988
Oh, well aren't you
the sweetest thing?

485
00:28:32.027 --> 00:28:33.407
He's real sweet, Ma.

486
00:28:33.408 --> 00:28:34.469
What is that in your hand,
by the way?

487
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:37.178
Oh, I got this at the bake sale
for the environment

488
00:28:37.213 --> 00:28:38.601
that those boys
were having.

489
00:28:38.621 --> 00:28:40.086
You know, you don't often
see white boys

490
00:28:40.121 --> 00:28:41.480
with the dreadlocks.

491
00:28:41.515 --> 00:28:43.692
- Mom.
- Yeah, it's a 100 percent pure Hawaiian

492
00:28:43.722 --> 00:28:46.115
- green for the environment.
- Jud...Can you please drop it?

493
00:28:46.408 --> 00:28:48.532
Yeah, then they baked it
with reefer in it.

494
00:28:48.567 --> 00:28:49.953
- No, it's canna... Hey!
- Please give me.

495
00:28:49.988 --> 00:28:51.907
Hey! It's my cheap day.
I can eat whatever I want.

496
00:28:51.942 --> 00:28:54.000
Please God, I'm gonna freak out.
Please do something right now, Dad.

497
00:28:54.035 --> 00:28:54.904
- Please do something right now.
- Okay, okay.

498
00:28:54.905 --> 00:28:56.447
Out of my way,
you wild hair!

499
00:28:56.448 --> 00:28:58.365
I can eat all the freaking
brownies I want!

500
00:28:58.400 --> 00:28:59.321
Sorry, fellas.

501
00:28:59.322 --> 00:29:00.820
I'm sorry and
you're welcome.

502
00:29:04.032 --> 00:29:05.683
We call it the Hot Freshmen 55.

503
00:29:05.684 --> 00:29:08.706
Sharsky hacked campus house and
stacked the dorm with pretty beddies.

504
00:29:12.193 --> 00:29:13.506
Oh, my God.
It's her.

505
00:29:13.693 --> 00:29:15.526
She's coming.
She sees me, she sees me.

506
00:29:18.041 --> 00:29:19.451
She's tight for me on one
on my to-do list.

507
00:29:19.486 --> 00:29:21.180
Do not bird-dog
my credit, you hear me?

508

00:42:25.629 --> 00:42:29.351
It's power, it's knowledge
can never be destroyed.

679
00:42:29.352 --> 00:42:32.389
It can only transform.

680
00:42:32.424 --> 00:42:35.746
- How is that possible?
- It has been absorbed

681
00:42:35.776 --> 00:42:37.682
by the human child.

682
00:42:37.683 --> 00:42:42.844
The key to saving our race
now lies within his mind.

683
00:42:42.884 --> 00:42:46.586
Well then, let me strip
the very flesh from his body.

684
00:42:46.621 --> 00:42:48.568
And you will,
my apprentice.

685
00:42:48.726 --> 00:42:53.588
In time. For millenia,
I have dreamed of my return

686
00:42:53.623 --> 00:42:58.489
to that wretched planet,
where I too was once betrayed,

687
00:42:58.519 --> 00:43:02.446
by the Primes
I call my brothers.

688
00:43:03.039 --> 00:43:09.986
Only a Prime can defeat me,
and now only one remains.

689
00:43:09.988 --> 00:43:13.694
Optimus.
He protects the boy.

690
00:43:13.729 --> 00:43:17.129
Then the boy
will lead us to him

691
00:43:17.130 --> 00:43:22.660
- and revenge will be ours.
- Yes.

692
00:43:23.537 --> 00:43:27.671
The boy will not escape us.
We have him in our sights.

693
00:43:29.028 --> 00:43:32.941
Without more Energon,
hatchlings will keep dying.

694
00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:43.044
Space, time, gravity.

695
00:43:46.622 --> 00:43:48.773
- Thank you.
- Finish that for me.

696
00:43:49.278 --> 00:43:51.314
We're going
on a journey together,

697
00:43:51.354 --> 00:43:52.579
you and I, today.

698
00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:57.420
All you, eager nubile young minds
on the very cusp of adulthood.

699
00:43:58.434 --> 00:44:01.039
And I shall be your consort,
your guide,

700
00:44:01.553 --> 00:44:05.490
your chaperone,
into the heart of darkness.

701
00:44:08.094 --> 00:44:09.832
Welcome to Astronomy 101.

702
00:44:11.433 --> 00:44:15.256
For what do we know
about the stars?

703
00:44:15.491 --> 00:44:19.330
Virgo... the virgin.

704
00:44:20.172 --> 00:44:22.101
Orion, the great hunter.

705
00:44:22.102 --> 00:44:24.290
These are no mere
twinkling diamonds

706
00:44:24.350 --> 00:44:26.783
for lovely maidens
to wish upon.

707
00:44:26.804 --> 00:44:31.135
No, they are diamond,
filled with a throbbing,

708
00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:33.957
savage and hemped-up energy.

709
00:44:33.992 --> 00:44:36.634
Behold the work of
Albert Einstein,

710
00:44:36.747 --> 00:44:39.350
a professor once,
like moi,

711
00:44:39.729 --> 00:44:41.733
- energy, in its mass temp...
- What are you doing?

712
00:44:41.734 --> 00:44:42.736
Put your hand down,
put your hand down.

713
00:44:42.737 --> 00:44:45.216
Young man,
there are no questions

714
00:44:45.247 --> 00:44:47.309
until I've reached
the climax of my lecture.

715
00:44:47.344 --> 00:44:48.652
I've just finished your book.
There's only one problem.

716
00:44:48.687 --> 00:44:50.187
Einstein's wrong.

717
00:44:51.398 --> 00:44:53.270
Energy doesn't go
mass times velocity light square

718
00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:54.613
in this dimension.
What about the other 17

719
00:44:54.614 --> 00:44:56.045
while we're impossible
to give 17?

720
00:44:57.782 --> 00:44:59.096
A clear example:

721
00:45:15.809 --> 00:45:17.286
Come on, guys,
I can't be the only one in class...

722
00:45:18.010 --> 00:45:22.957
Young man, I will not be punked
in front of the dean.

723
00:45:24.435 --> 00:45:29.388
No, this is my universe here.
Do you understand?

724
00:45:29.423 --> 00:45:33.042
I am the Alpha
and the Omega.

725
00:45:33.077 --> 00:45:34.417
- Get out of my class.
- Yes, sir.

726
00:45:38.542 --> 00:45:41.033
Any one else care to have
some sort of mental breakdown?

727
00:45:51.073 --> 00:45:53.574
Hi, Bones.
Hi!

728
00:45:53.908 --> 00:45:56.465
Hi! Oh yes,
that's a good boy.

729
00:45:56.896 --> 00:45:58.675
<i>Oh, what a good boy,
you are.</i>

730
00:46:03.436 --> 00:46:05.111
Hey, Bones.

731
00:46:05.153 --> 00:46:06.465
<i>You hungry?</i>

732
00:46:13.926 --> 00:46:15.119
Here you go.

733
00:46:23.073 --> 00:46:25.037
- Yes, Samuel.
- Hello? Mikaela.

734
00:46:25.157 --> 00:46:27.905
I can't believe you're gonna
stand me up on our first web chat date.

735
00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:29.228
Something just happened
to me, okay?

736
00:46:29.229 --> 00:46:31.203
<i>- Wait, you finally hit puberty?
- No, no, no,</i>

737
00:46:31.238 --> 00:46:32.253
Stop laughing.
This is serious.

738
00:46:32.254 --> 00:46:33.169
Okay, remember
I was telling you about

739
00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:35.157
my great-great-grandfather,
Archibald Witwicky?

740
00:46:35.158 --> 00:46:36.025
Do you remember?

741
00:46:36.026 --> 00:46:37.331
Watch where you're
supposed to go!

742
00:46:37.332 --> 00:46:39.723
Okay, remember
I was telling you about, okay...

743
00:46:39.758 --> 00:46:41.619
Can you stop...
Watch the foot! Watch your foot!

744
00:46:41.654 --> 00:46:44.670
Mikaela, okay, my great-great-grandfather
went to this Arctic mission, right?

745
00:46:44.705 --> 00:46:46.521
And he saw Megatron,
Megatron zapped him

746
00:46:46.551 --> 00:46:48.437
and he started seeing
these crazy symbols, okay.

747
00:46:48.471 --> 00:46:49.889
Well, now I'm seeing them too.
Excuse me.

748
00:46:49.908 --> 00:46:52.529
I just wrote a 903-page
Astronomy book at 32.6 seconds

749
00:46:52.564 --> 00:46:54.026
and had a meltdown
in the middle of my class.

750
00:46:54.061 --> 00:46:56.097
I am seeing symbols
ever since I...

751
00:46:57.383 --> 00:47:00.286
- Since what?
- Ever since I touched the Cube sliver.

752
00:47:01.547 --> 00:47:02.857
Do you have it?

753
00:47:02.858 --> 00:47:05.066
No, how about it's in
the shop safe? It's fine.

754
00:47:05.101 --> 00:47:08.241
Mi...Mikaela, do not touch it, okay?
Don't touch it.

755
00:47:08.281 --> 00:47:09.417
<i>I'm not gonna touch it,</i>

756
00:47:09.418 --> 00:47:12.103
Sam, it's fine. It's locked away,
no one knows where it is.

757
00:47:12.328 --> 00:47:13.650
But I do.

758
00:47:15.455 --> 00:47:17.430
You're hot,
but you're ain't too bright.

759
00:47:19.894 --> 00:47:21.667
There we go.

760
00:47:23.978 --> 00:47:26.360
Oh, big son of a bitch!

761
00:47:28.955 --> 00:47:31.068
What are you looking at,
Slobberpuss?

762
00:47:32.190 --> 00:47:33.905
Ah, what the...

763
00:47:34.482 --> 00:47:36.114
This is a fricking
House of Horrors.

764
00:47:42.417 --> 00:47:43.917
Hold on.

765
00:47:56.930 --> 00:47:58.780
Is that the best
you got, huh?

766
00:47:58.815 --> 00:48:00.129
Is that the best
you can do?

767
00:48:01.818 --> 00:48:03.480
What are you doing here,
you little freak?

768
00:48:03.624 --> 00:48:06.455
Ow, that's my eye,
you crazy bitch!

769
00:48:06.529 --> 00:48:07.950
You gotta talk now?

770
00:48:08.727 --> 00:48:12.167
I... I seek knowledge of the Cube.
The Fallen demands me.

771
00:48:12.202 --> 00:48:13.017
What knowledge?

772
00:48:13.018 --> 00:48:14.993
You got the shot, I need the shot,
give me the shot, I need the shot.

773
00:48:15.022 --> 00:48:15.907
Give me the shot,
they're gonna whack me,

774
00:48:15.908 --> 00:48:17.661
I'm gonna be dead
without that shot.

775
00:48:17.662 --> 00:48:21.332
Easy Warrior Goddess,
I'm just a little salvage scrap drone.

776
00:48:21.367 --> 00:48:23.216
- Then I'm your worst nightmare.
- Ow, ow, ow, ow!

777
00:48:23.659 --> 00:48:24.688
Hey, hey!

778
00:48:24.689 --> 00:48:26.178
<i>- What the hell was that?
- I'll tell you later,</i>

779
00:48:26.228 --> 00:48:27.747
just not on
open phone line, okay?

780
00:48:27.786 --> 00:48:29.821
I'm gonna get on a plane right now.
I'll be there later this afternoon.

781
00:48:29.856 --> 00:48:31.502
Just be careful, Sam.

782
00:48:39.276 --> 00:48:42.046
And have any stranger giving you
anything suspicious to carry on today?

783
00:48:42.081 --> 00:48:43.510
Yeah, a large box!

784
00:48:43.903 --> 00:48:45.251
- No.
- Good.

785
00:48:57.892 --> 00:49:00.527
Major, incoming SOS
from Autobots.

786
00:49:00.562 --> 00:49:04.307
Multiple Decepticon contacts in motion.
Vicinity eastern United States, sir.

787
00:49:04.565 --> 00:49:07.248
- Hansvin, how many?
- Unclear, sir.

788
00:49:07.531 --> 00:49:09.135
Well, get clear.

789
00:49:13.786 --> 00:49:16.630
Autobots on the move.
Splitting them into two teams, sir.

790
00:49:16.665 --> 00:49:19.311
Unarching their course, somewhere heading
to New York and Philadelphia.

791
00:49:19.346 --> 00:49:22.916
Full weapons deployment.
Wheels up in 20 minutes!

792
00:49:33.255 --> 00:49:35.921
<i>Flight Chairman
throughout West Beverly Hills.</i>

793
00:49:36.729 --> 00:49:40.752
M'amor (my lover), can I interest you
in Mayteam Zookeeper's Special?

794
00:49:40.833 --> 00:49:43.170
Extra large supertees
with every known animal as a topping.

795
00:49:43.171 --> 00:49:45.202
Basic lengths.
Only 18 inches of meat.

796
00:49:45.256 --> 00:49:47.352
Oh, so you're a vegetarian.
Alright, it's cool. I am too.

797
00:49:48.057 --> 00:49:49.021
Is Sam home?

798
00:49:49.022 --> 00:49:52.276
Sam... I think he died but,
why don't we check?

799
00:49:52.881 --> 00:49:54.227
- Here we are.
- Hey.

800
00:49:54.842 --> 00:49:55.934
Have you had
a song stuck in yours?

801
00:49:55.935 --> 00:49:57.340
It's like the worst song ever,
but you can't help

802
00:49:57.375 --> 00:49:58.952
whistle it or sing it.
It's like, repeats itself,

803
00:49:58.987 --> 00:50:01.148
repeats itself, repeats itself,
repeats itself, repeats itself,

804
00:50:01.149 --> 00:50:03.178
repeats itself...
Kitten calendar, kitten calendar,

805
00:50:03.209 --> 00:50:04.272
- kitten calendar, kitten calendar,
- Dude,

806
00:50:04.273 --> 00:50:05.499
- kitten calendar, kitten calendar,
- What the F?

807
00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:07.596
I know you're freaking out.
Don't freak out, don't freak out.

808
00:50:07.647 --> 00:50:10.514
Easy fix. Puzzle, code, in my head.
Now it's on the walls.

809
00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:11.323
Everything is good.

810
00:50:11.324 --> 00:50:12.714
This is the part that...

811
00:50:17.089 --> 00:50:18.391
Okay,
what were you saying?

812
00:50:18.392 --> 00:50:21.591
Alice, I'm horrified you had
to see this. Let's go.

813
00:50:21.862 --> 00:50:23.287
- Get out.
- What?

814
00:50:23.288 --> 00:50:25.288
Wait, wait, wait.
C-Can I just sit and watch?

815
00:50:25.323 --> 00:50:26.856
I-I'll eat my pizza quietly.

816
00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:30.418
Sam, I knew there were
something special about you.

817
00:50:30.453 --> 00:50:31.566
Really?

818
00:50:33.061 --> 00:50:35.109
And I know you know
what happens

819
00:50:35.374 --> 00:50:37.423
when two people
in the room get together...

820
00:50:38.511 --> 00:50:42.208
they're genuinely amazing...
in bed.

821
00:50:43.579 --> 00:50:44.952
- Thank you.
- No problem.

822
00:50:46.166 --> 00:50:48.801
Alright, listen, hold on.
Boundaries. Flight on the plane.

823
00:50:48.830 --> 00:50:50.145
Okay, I'm very ticklish.

824
00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:52.773
- You have the need, Sam. Relax!
- Why?

825
00:50:52.808 --> 00:50:54.136
Oh, jeez!

826
00:50:55.394 --> 00:50:58.337
Uh, what about this economy?
It's crazy, isn't it?

827
00:51:01.317 --> 00:51:04.565
- You are very aggressive.
- Just relax.

828
00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:06.012
You want
some jerky meatloaf?

829
00:51:11.867 --> 00:51:13.270
Sam?

830
00:51:15.527 --> 00:51:16.667
Mikaela.

831
00:51:16.668 --> 00:51:18.029
Is that your girlfriend?

832
00:51:19.321 --> 00:51:20.817
Ex.

833
00:51:21.277 --> 00:51:26.246
Mikaela, wait...
I can explain every...

834
00:51:45.705 --> 00:51:47.326
Sam, your bed-buddy, Alice.

835
00:52:06.876 --> 00:52:07.898
What...

836
00:52:07.899 --> 00:52:09.001
- It's coming!
- This is an alien robot.

837
00:52:09.002 --> 00:52:10.584
- You gotta move. Just run.
- They're real?

838
00:52:17.466 --> 00:52:20.049
Oh my God, I can't believe
I once had sex with her in my dream.

839
00:52:20.084 --> 00:52:21.694
I can tell that you really
missed me a lot, Sam.

840
00:52:21.724 --> 00:52:23.280
Look, it's not my fault, okay?

841
00:52:23.584 --> 00:52:24.948
Listen, listen.
I'm a victim.

842
00:52:24.968 --> 00:52:26.293
Oh, you were a victim?
Of what?

843
00:52:26.328 --> 00:52:28.410
- Of what? A little 80-pound girl...
- Of...Of...

844
00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:30.178
It's like getting humped
in the neck by a mountain ox.

845
00:52:30.193 --> 00:52:31.574
You didn't have to put
your tongue in her mouth.

846
00:52:31.609 --> 00:52:32.598
- I didn't.
- You did.

847
00:52:32.599 --> 00:52:35.031
Look, you ever had your stomach tounged
by a mountain ox with a 5-foot tong?

848
00:52:35.066 --> 00:52:36.707
It's not fun for me,
okay, Mikaela.

849
00:52:36.742 --> 00:52:40.390
And it smelled like...like diesel.
Like a diesel he dinged to it.

850
00:52:40.425 --> 00:52:41.881
You're such a little girl.

851
00:52:41.916 --> 00:52:43.963
You have ten seconds
of silence, right now.

852
00:52:43.998 --> 00:52:45.268
I'm not talking to you
for ten seconds.

853
00:52:45.269 --> 00:52:47.034
No, you can't give me the silence.
You know what?

854
00:52:47.246 --> 00:52:49.669
I'm not talking to you for ten seconds.
You have three seconds left.

855
00:52:49.704 --> 00:52:51.062
You know, what?
You can give me the silence you want,

856
00:52:51.097 --> 00:52:52.798
all you want but you can't
give me the talking...

857
00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:53.982
W-What were you gonna say?

858
00:52:53.983 --> 00:52:55.449
I hope you had a lot of fun
because this...

859
00:52:55.484 --> 00:52:56.725
This is over!

860
00:52:56.726 --> 00:52:57.993
Did she finally led you
to orbits?

861
00:52:57.994 --> 00:53:00.574
You threw a broom?
She did it, she went in it?

862
00:53:02.279 --> 00:53:04.426
...gestating in that inside of you.
You're going right now, bro.

863
00:53:04.461 --> 00:53:06.489
You need to vomit right now.
Yak it, yak it.

864
00:53:06.590 --> 00:53:08.582
- Right now!
- Who are you?

865
00:53:08.797 --> 00:53:10.918
I am the only one who
everybody can spit, okay?

866
00:53:10.953 --> 00:53:11.953
I'm the key to this.

867
00:53:11.954 --> 00:53:13.531
Aliens; they want me
because of my site.

868
00:53:13.911 --> 00:53:14.965
Whoa!

869
00:53:24.944 --> 00:53:26.201
Run!

870
00:53:29.924 --> 00:53:31.273
Mikaela!

871
00:53:48.972 --> 00:53:50.748
Watch out.
We get in.

872
00:53:51.219 --> 00:53:52.877
It's a bomb!

873
00:54:02.389 --> 00:54:04.053
We gotta get
that box.

874
00:54:07.301 --> 00:54:08.297
This way.

875
00:54:08.298 --> 00:54:10.278
<i>Hey, let me out,
let me out!</i>

876
00:54:11.375 --> 00:54:13.217
Oh my God,
you know to hot-wire a car?

877
00:54:13.490 --> 00:54:15.001
- That's so hot.
- Drive, drive, drive.

878
00:54:15.036 --> 00:54:16.741
She went there,
she went there!

879
00:54:19.901 --> 00:54:20.919
W-wait!

880
00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:22.507
They can....

881
00:54:25.776 --> 00:54:27.372
Cut, cut, cut.

882
00:54:34.217 --> 00:54:35.838
Oh God!

883
00:54:41.224 --> 00:54:42.620
Kiss this, bitch.

884
00:54:48.329 --> 00:54:49.948
Drive, drive, drive,
drive, drive, drive.

885
00:54:52.977 --> 00:54:54.461
Okay, so what else's
going right now, alright,

886
00:54:54.496 --> 00:54:55.945
did you guys just mess
with the minor details?

887
00:54:58.437 --> 00:55:00.583
Thing you saw back there.
That was a little babe.

888
00:55:06.115 --> 00:55:08.507
Whoa!
Oh my God! Oh my God!

889
00:55:12.398 --> 00:55:14.144
Sam!

890
00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:19.828
- Sam!
- Hold on!

891
00:55:19.829 --> 00:55:21.054
Hold on.

892
00:55:23.029 --> 00:55:24.536
Sam!

893
00:55:26.676 --> 00:55:29.481
I don't want to die!
We're going to die! Oh my God!

894
00:55:54.828 --> 00:55:56.465
Oh, Jesus!
Oh, jeez!

895
00:56:05.092 --> 00:56:06.833
Come here, boy.

896
00:56:08.099 --> 00:56:09.448
Closer.

897
00:56:10.404 --> 00:56:11.405
Okay.

898
00:56:11.406 --> 00:56:15.012
- You remember me, don't you?
- I did what you said, okay?

899
00:56:16.174 --> 00:56:17.717
- Just don't hurt us.
- Shut up!

900
00:56:18.629 --> 00:56:20.025
Sam!

901
00:56:30.263 --> 00:56:33.450
It feels good
to grab your first.

902
00:56:34.882 --> 00:56:39.691
I am going to kill you,
slowly, painfully.

903
00:56:39.726 --> 00:56:44.295
But first, we have
some delicate work to do.

904
00:56:47.958 --> 00:56:50.121
I could snap your ribs off.

905
00:56:50.483 --> 00:56:54.290
Doctor, examine
this alien specimen.

906
00:56:56.776 --> 00:56:58.394
Sick of your face now.

907
00:57:19.573 --> 00:57:21.385
Go that way.

908
00:57:29.410 --> 00:57:30.835
A wormy that's crabby...

909
00:57:43.618 --> 00:57:46.159
- Oh, there they are.
- That's what I'm seeing in my head.

910
00:57:46.194 --> 00:57:49.152
These symbols can lead us
to the Energon source.

911
00:57:50.172 --> 00:57:52.696
We must tear the brain!

912
00:57:55.092 --> 00:57:58.029
Brain?
What does he mean by my brain?

913
00:57:58.064 --> 00:58:00.153
Well, you have something
on your mind.

914
00:58:00.187 --> 00:58:02.535
- Something I need.
- Hold on. I know you're pissed.

915
00:58:02.555 --> 00:58:03.263
I know you're pissed.

916
00:58:03.264 --> 00:58:05.162
Because I tried to kill you
and it's completely understandable.

917
00:58:05.197 --> 00:58:06.742
Somebody tried to kill me,
I'd be upset too.

918
00:58:06.778 --> 00:58:09.272
I think that
we have an opportunity here

919
00:58:09.307 --> 00:58:12.326
to start a new and...and
develop our relationship,

920
00:58:12.616 --> 00:58:14.912
and...and,
see where it leads us, okay?

921
00:58:14.947 --> 00:58:16.188
So you just call
doctor inspection,

922
00:58:16.189 --> 00:58:17.836
I'll let you talk
in five seconds.

923
00:58:18.157 --> 00:58:19.297
W-Wait...

924
00:58:25.512 --> 00:58:26.858
Go, go.

925
00:58:30.570 --> 00:58:32.012
Go, go, go.

926
00:58:58.492 --> 00:58:59.987
Sam!

927
00:59:15.992 --> 00:59:17.362
Go, go, go, go!

928
00:59:17.896 --> 00:59:19.440
Here he comes!

929
00:59:26.294 --> 00:59:29.372
Hide, Sam!
Hide.

930
00:59:38.097 --> 00:59:39.778
Weak.

931
00:59:41.668 --> 00:59:43.132
Puny.

932
00:59:43.193 --> 00:59:44.617
Voiced-up.

933
00:59:48.486 --> 00:59:51.117
Junkyard drone.

934
00:59:52.106 --> 00:59:53.875
Decepticons!

935
01:00:03.267 --> 01:00:05.271
Come here, boy.

936
01:00:35.231 --> 01:00:38.662
There is another source of Energon
hidden on this planet.

937
01:00:38.697 --> 01:00:40.775
The boy can lead us to it.

938
01:00:45.335 --> 01:00:46.714
Optimus!

939
01:01:00.006 --> 01:01:05.515
Is the future of our race
not worth a single human life?

940
01:01:05.516 --> 01:01:06.673
Op, get up!

941
01:01:06.674 --> 01:01:09.128
You'll never stop at one.

942
01:01:10.441 --> 01:01:12.372
I'll take you all alive.

943
01:01:54.127 --> 01:01:55.948
Sam, where are you?

944
01:02:00.175 --> 01:02:03.162
You are so weak.

945
01:02:27.281 --> 01:02:31.777
At last, Prime is dead.

946
01:02:39.993 --> 01:02:42.296
Sam, run.

947
01:02:54.846 --> 01:02:56.492
Autobots, attack!

948
01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:02.860
Bumblebee,
get them out of here.

949
01:03:16.806 --> 01:03:18.348
This is Lennox.

950
01:03:30.741 --> 01:03:32.137
That went well.

951
01:03:32.858 --> 01:03:34.536
Lost the boy, Master.

952
01:03:34.576 --> 01:03:36.994
The Autobots must be shielding
the signals.

953
01:03:37.468 --> 01:03:39.778
- I can't even rely on you.
- Sorry. No.

954
01:03:39.808 --> 01:03:41.976
What a simple insect!

955
01:03:43.236 --> 01:03:46.173
- What insect amongst severed billion...
- Shut up.

956
01:03:47.803 --> 01:03:49.449
It could be anywhere.

957
01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:53.637
Then we will force them
to find him for us.

958
01:03:53.951 --> 01:03:56.916
It's time for the world
to know of our presence.

959
01:03:57.211 --> 01:04:00.442
No more disguises,
no mercy!

960
01:04:00.744 --> 01:04:04.365
Time has come
for my master's arrival.

961
01:04:08.236 --> 01:04:11.726
Decepticons, mobilise.

962
01:04:11.727 --> 01:04:13.733
It is time.

963
01:04:28.306 --> 01:04:30.845
<i>Oh, that single's good!</i>

964
01:04:31.046 --> 01:04:33.359
<i>Speaking French
is so exciting.</i>

965
01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:35.216
Oh God,
who is this?

966
01:04:37.171 --> 01:04:40.176
Hello... I mean,
uh, bon...bonswa (good afternoon)!

967
01:04:41.344 --> 01:04:43.325
What?
Who is this?

968
01:04:44.696 --> 01:04:46.197
Oh, for Pete's sakes.

969
01:04:46.391 --> 01:04:49.262
I'm not impressed
with your perverted mouth breathing.

970
01:04:50.701 --> 01:04:52.562
New York City

971
01:05:29.538 --> 01:05:30.844
Oh, jeez.

972
01:05:30.845 --> 01:05:33.449
You are invading my space.
I'm gonna have to drop you.

973
01:05:33.484 --> 01:05:34.856
Would you get out
of here?

974
01:05:34.857 --> 01:05:36.627
Might freak me out.

975
01:05:37.331 --> 01:05:38.605
We're gonna try
new things.

976
01:05:38.606 --> 01:05:40.178
Looks like Candian goosepoop.

977
01:05:42.618 --> 01:05:44.214
It's nasty.

978
01:05:44.215 --> 01:05:47.202
US FLEET 2

979
01:05:49.092 --> 01:05:50.478
That's fine, 1-2-5.

980
01:06:56.100 --> 01:06:59.636
Revenge is mine.

<i>As you've seen,</i>

992
01:08:09.277 --> 01:08:12.148
<i>we can destroy

<i>The FBI is still trying

01:09:19.197 --> 01:09:22.866
We're dead, bro.
FBI, CIA, we're wanted fugitives now.

1019
01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:24.605
I just need you to focus
just one minute, man.

1020
01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:26.402
This thing is blowing
to a whole another level, alright.

1021
01:09:26.437 --> 01:09:27.887
- You know one thing...
- Remove this thing.

1022
01:09:27.888 --> 01:09:29.007
They can track us.
Do you see this?

1023
01:09:29.008 --> 01:09:30.214
What?

1024
01:09:32.146 --> 01:09:33.521
They can track us?

1025
01:09:33.522 --> 01:09:35.062
Like satellite-track us?

1026
01:09:35.255 --> 01:09:37.275
Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay,
I'm not even with you guys.

1027
01:09:37.306 --> 01:09:39.878
Technically, I'm like a hostage.
This is kidnapping. Enough...

1028
01:09:39.908 --> 01:09:41.349
Yo, Leo!

1029
01:09:41.350 --> 01:09:43.603
This thing's gonna give me
a heart attack, I swear.

1030
01:09:43.638 --> 01:09:45.635
- That's 'cause you was a wuss.
- You did force me into the car, right?

1031
01:09:45.670 --> 01:09:47.003
- So...
- Oh, I think you scared.

1032
01:09:47.038 --> 01:09:48.181
Hey, Mudflap.

1033
01:09:48.182 --> 01:09:49.593
What are we going to do
with this shrimp taco?

1034
01:09:49.633 --> 01:09:51.208
Just pop a cap in his ass,
throw him in the trunk

1035
01:09:51.239 --> 01:09:52.568
and nobody gonna know nothing,
y'know I mean?

1036
01:09:52.569 --> 01:09:54.545
- Wait, now my trunk...
- Yo, bumper cars,

1037
01:09:54.546 --> 01:09:56.218
Check it out.
I'm hearing you, okay?

1038
01:09:56.248 --> 01:09:58.018
I'm right here
and I can hear you.

1039
01:09:58.048 --> 01:10:00.622
No one's popping any caps
in any asses, okay?

1040
01:10:00.641 --> 01:10:02.085
I've had a hell of a day.

1041
01:10:03.150 --> 01:10:05.506
Why don't you get a haircut
with your bitch ass?

1042
01:10:05.507 --> 01:10:06.638
Go whine
to your boyfriend.

1043
01:10:06.639 --> 01:10:08.339
Listen Sam, I know
what I'm gonna do, man.

1044
01:10:08.374 --> 01:10:09.503
Look, I'm just going to go
to the authorities

1045
01:10:09.504 --> 01:10:11.000
and tell them the truth.
Like I had nothing to do with this,

1046
01:10:11.019 --> 01:10:11.885
- I'm an accomplice.
- Hey, hey!

1047
01:10:11.886 --> 01:10:13.496
You wanted this, right?
You wanted the real deal?

1048
01:10:13.537 --> 01:10:15.632
'Cause that's what this is.
Wake up! You're in the middle of it.

1049
01:10:15.667 --> 01:10:17.632
You wanna run, go ahead,
no one's stopping you.

1050
01:10:18.939 --> 01:10:20.644
Stop complaining.

1051
01:10:56.822 --> 01:10:58.233
What is the meaning
of this?

1052
01:10:58.669 --> 01:11:00.659
You dare
point your gun at me?

1053
01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:04.491
You want a piece of me?
I will tear you apart!

1054
01:11:06.321 --> 01:11:08.655
Drop your weapons!
Drop your weapons!

1055
01:11:08.690 --> 01:11:10.396
- Tell them to lower the weapons.
- Tell them first.

1056
01:11:10.427 --> 01:11:12.536
- Tell them to lower the weapons!
- Major, there's nothing I can do.

1057
01:11:12.575 --> 01:11:13.651
Talk to him.

1058
01:11:13.652 --> 01:11:15.504
US teams deactivated, Major.

1059
01:11:16.047 --> 01:11:18.646
You are decease
anti-Decepticon operations,

1060
01:11:18.676 --> 01:11:21.049
and return to Diego Garcia.
Any further orders?

1061
01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:23.303
No. We take our orders
direct from Chairman Morshower.

1062
01:11:23.344 --> 01:11:25.519
Well, I'll see your chairman
and the Joint Chiefs of Staff

1063
01:11:25.549 --> 01:11:27.878
but I will raise you
a President of the United States.

1064
01:11:27.918 --> 01:11:29.549
I have operational command now.

1065
01:11:29.584 --> 01:11:31.917
An alien blood feud
has been brought to our shores

1066
01:11:31.953 --> 01:11:33.639
for which our soldiers
are paying the price.

1067
01:11:34.092 --> 01:11:37.112
The secret is out.
This is our war now.

1068
01:11:37.308 --> 01:11:38.989
And we will win it
as we always have,

1069
01:11:39.171 --> 01:11:41.263
with a coordinated
military strategy.

1070
01:11:41.298 --> 01:11:43.941
This fool
is terribly misinformed.

1071
01:11:44.134 --> 01:11:45.700
You're gonna get every assets
that you've got.

1072
01:11:45.735 --> 01:11:47.439
What we need is
to draw our battle plans.

1073
01:11:47.622 --> 01:11:49.815
What we explore every possible,
diplomatic solution.

1074
01:11:49.816 --> 01:11:51.230
Like what:
Handing over the kid?

1075
01:11:52.617 --> 01:11:54.309
All options
are being considered.

1076
01:11:55.093 --> 01:11:57.069
Whatever the Decepticons
are after,

1077
01:11:57.441 --> 01:11:58.890
this is just the start.

1078
01:11:59.011 --> 01:12:00.633
Wait, there is no negotiating
with them.

1079
01:12:00.654 --> 01:12:02.307
I'm ordering you
to stand down.

1080
01:12:02.308 --> 01:12:03.737
You won't be needing this
any more.

1081
01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:06.145
Get your assets
back to base.

1082
01:12:06.657 --> 01:12:09.262
Take that scrap metal
back to Diego Garcia.

1083
01:12:11.125 --> 01:12:11.976
Let's go.

1084
01:12:13.205 --> 01:12:14.885
I really don't
like that dude.

1085
01:12:15.478 --> 01:12:17.341
He's a asshole.

1086
01:12:17.603 --> 01:12:20.019
<i>Autobots,
report to hangar for transport.</i>

1087
01:12:20.221 --> 01:12:22.850
Ironhide,
we should leave this planet.

1088
01:12:22.992 --> 01:12:25.407
That's not what
Optimus would want.

1089
01:12:44.616 --> 01:12:46.337
There's nothing
that you could have done.

1090
01:12:51.172 --> 01:12:53.236
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1091
01:12:56.416 --> 01:12:59.223
Bee, if you hate me,
I understand.

1092
01:13:07.077 --> 01:13:08.747
I messed up.

1093
01:13:09.616 --> 01:13:11.156
I'm sorry.

1094
01:13:12.266 --> 01:13:16.409
- Young fella, you are...
- ...person I care about most in my life.

1095
01:13:16.444 --> 01:13:19.247
- If there's anything you need...
- I won't be far away.

1096
01:13:21.514 --> 01:13:22.899
He's dead
because of me.

1097
01:13:23.668 --> 01:13:25.390
He came in
to protect me instead.

1098
01:13:25.731 --> 01:13:28.414
There's some things
you just can't change.

1099
01:13:28.449 --> 01:13:29.925
So this sacrifice was...

1100
01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:32.658
will not have been in vain,
hallelujah!

1101
01:13:34.128 --> 01:13:35.954
We make it right
when we turn myself in.

1102
01:13:36.197 --> 01:13:38.175
But we,
we've got to stick together.

1103
01:13:42.851 --> 01:13:44.571
You're not gonna do that.

1104
01:13:46.099 --> 01:13:47.335
Yes, I am.

1105
01:13:50.965 --> 01:13:53.652
Everything we worked for
will be wiped out.

1106
01:13:53.653 --> 01:13:55.383
In one day.

1107
01:13:57.588 --> 01:13:59.025
- You two.
- Huh?

1108
01:13:59.579 --> 01:14:01.255
Hey, you know the glyphs?

1109
01:14:01.510 --> 01:14:03.306
The symbols that have been
rattling around in my head.

1110
01:14:03.845 --> 01:14:05.898
That's old school, yo.

1111
01:14:05.899 --> 01:14:08.072
That's like...
That's Cybertonian.

1112
01:14:08.111 --> 01:14:09.678
Oh, that's some
serious stuff in there.

1113
01:14:09.679 --> 01:14:11.335
They gotta mean something,
like a message...

1114
01:14:11.370 --> 01:14:12.722
or, like a...
like a map!

1115
01:14:12.757 --> 01:14:14.300
Like a map
to an Energon source.

1116
01:14:14.313 --> 01:14:15.566
Can you read this?

1117
01:14:15.605 --> 01:14:17.401
- Read? Nah.
- You see that?

1118
01:14:17.812 --> 01:14:19.485
No, we...we don't really do
much reading.

1119
01:14:19.525 --> 01:14:20.798
- Not so much.
- Well if you can't read it,

1120
01:14:20.799 --> 01:14:21.745
we gotta find
somebody who can.

1121
01:14:21.746 --> 01:14:23.802
Oh, look, who came
stashing and back.

1122
01:14:23.837 --> 01:14:25.491
Hair grown like a chip,
there, look it.

1123
01:14:25.526 --> 01:14:27.664
I had a bit of a mild
panic attack earlier, alright?

1124
01:14:27.695 --> 01:14:28.983
That's 'cause
you're a pussy.

1125
01:14:28.984 --> 01:14:30.672
I think I'm allowed that
considering what I've been through

1126
01:14:30.702 --> 01:14:32.231
and... I heard
you have a problem.

1127
01:14:32.250 --> 01:14:33.882
I think I know someone
who can help.

1128
01:14:34.137 --> 01:14:36.470
- Who?
- Robo-Warrior.

1129
01:14:37.344 --> 01:14:40.103
[SONG: New Divide
BAND: Linkin Park]

1130
01:14:40.245 --> 01:14:41.549
This guy, Robo-Warrior...

1131
01:14:41.550 --> 01:14:44.101
Everything about anything alien,
he's supposed to know.

1132
01:14:44.136 --> 01:14:45.503
One time
we hacked this site

1133
01:14:45.532 --> 01:14:50.177
and maybe, I saw some of your, uh...
alien drawings or whatever.

1134
01:15:02.632 --> 01:15:03.896
This is it.

1135
01:15:04.010 --> 01:15:05.748
Yep, deli. Good front.

1136
01:15:06.202 --> 01:15:08.619
Alright, wait here.
I'll give you the go/no go, alright?

1137
01:15:09.467 --> 01:15:14.753
Number 42, we got your...
Right here...

1138
01:15:14.754 --> 01:15:16.554
Show me Who's next?

1139
01:15:19.870 --> 01:15:21.487
Ma, you want me
to cut my handle off or what?

1140
01:15:21.517 --> 01:15:24.542
- You order a terrible piece of fishing.
- I'm like a ninja, with a blade.

1141
01:15:24.562 --> 01:15:25.659
Get out of here!

1142
01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:28.081
Hey, Sam!
Watch your reach, huh?

1143
01:15:28.101 --> 01:15:29.570
Take a number,
young man.

1144
01:15:30.165 --> 01:15:31.832
Robo-Warrior.

1145
01:15:33.327 --> 01:15:34.360
Know him?

1146
01:15:34.361 --> 01:15:35.505
I never heard of him.

1147
01:15:35.506 --> 01:15:37.816
You never heard of
TheRealEffingDeal.com?

1148
01:15:37.817 --> 01:15:40.657
You must be talking about
that amateur blog operation

1149
01:15:40.692 --> 01:15:42.866
with GameBoy level security.

1150
01:15:42.867 --> 01:15:44.572
Robo-Warrior.

1151
01:15:44.856 --> 01:15:46.898
It's him. It's him!
That's the guy right there.

1152
01:15:46.933 --> 01:15:48.363
That's him.

1153
01:15:48.927 --> 01:15:50.379
No.

1154
01:15:50.885 --> 01:15:51.919
You gotta be kidding me.

1155
01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:54.423
Alright, meat store's closed.
Everybody out!

1156
01:15:54.424 --> 01:15:56.054
Go, right now!

1157
01:15:57.311 --> 01:15:58.732
Wait a minute,
you know this guy?

1158
01:15:58.733 --> 01:16:00.216
- We're old friends.
- Whoa, friend,

1159
01:16:00.251 --> 01:16:02.929
you are the case
that shut down Sector 7.

1160
01:16:02.930 --> 01:16:04.471
Got the tie-bash
disbandment,

1161
01:16:04.506 --> 01:16:07.823
no more security clearance,
no retirement, no nothing.

1162
01:16:07.858 --> 01:16:10.915
All 'cause of you,
and your little criminal girlfriend.

1163
01:16:10.944 --> 01:16:12.484
Look at her now,
so mature.

1164
01:16:12.485 --> 01:16:14.861
Moron, where's the wifresh?

1165
01:16:14.896 --> 01:16:17.238
Don't catch me
with the thing.

1166
01:16:17.298 --> 01:16:18.617
- Yakov!
- What?

1167
01:16:18.798 --> 01:16:20.879
You don't get Christmas bonus
just standing around.

1168
01:16:21.003 --> 01:16:22.852
You want those new teeth
you saw in SkyMall?

1169
01:16:23.089 --> 01:16:24.970
- It's my dream.
- Help around.

1170
01:16:25.824 --> 01:16:27.556
- You live with your momma?
- No, my momma lives with me.

1171
01:16:27.566 --> 01:16:28.515
It's a big difference.

1172
01:16:28.516 --> 01:16:30.247
They got your face
all over the news, alien boy.

1173
01:16:30.282 --> 01:16:32.405
- Yeah, I know.
- And NBE-1, still kicking, huh?

1174
01:16:32.662 --> 01:16:33.945
How did that happen?

1175
01:16:33.946 --> 01:16:36.000
Don't answer.
I don't know what you're hiding,

1176
01:16:36.035 --> 01:16:37.354
but I don't want anything
to do with it

1177
01:16:37.355 --> 01:16:39.684
so, goodbye, you never saw me.
I got bagels to schmidt.

1178
01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:41.387
Well, give me 5 seconds.

1179
01:16:41.388 --> 01:16:42.876
Look, hold on,
I need your help.

1180
01:16:42.912 --> 01:16:45.336
Really,
you need my help?

1181
01:16:45.627 --> 01:16:46.489
I need...

1182
01:16:46.490 --> 01:16:48.789
Look, I am slowly
losing my mind, okay?

1183
01:16:48.882 --> 01:16:50.694
I had a little Crabbot,
placed the device

1184
01:16:50.724 --> 01:16:52.249
deep into the soft tissues
of my brain,

1185
01:16:52.284 --> 01:16:53.966
and started projecting
little alien symbols

1186
01:16:54.001 --> 01:16:54.994
like a whole freaking movie

1187
01:16:54.995 --> 01:16:56.746
and on top of that,
I'm a wanted fugitive.

1188
01:16:56.781 --> 01:16:57.939
So you think
you got it rough?

1189
01:16:57.940 --> 01:17:00.113
You said it projected images
of your brain?

1190
01:17:00.114 --> 01:17:01.439
Right.

1191
01:17:01.556 --> 01:17:02.873
Meat locker, now!

1192
01:17:03.491 --> 01:17:04.763
- Dead pigs.
- Yuck.

1193
01:17:04.764 --> 01:17:06.718
What you're about to see
is top secret.

1194
01:17:07.684 --> 01:17:09.595
Do not tell my mother.

1195
01:17:10.714 --> 01:17:11.885
Dead pigs, swine flu.

1196
01:17:11.886 --> 01:17:13.031
- Not good.
- Now you know.

1197
01:17:13.032 --> 01:17:14.771
Next time, you eat
a goat or a pig.

1198
01:17:14.772 --> 01:17:16.057
There's a story
behind this.

1199
01:17:16.058 --> 01:17:17.373
Yeah,
there's a story.

1200
01:17:17.777 --> 01:17:19.642
<i>...you're saying
you believe in aliens?</i>

1201
01:17:19.677 --> 01:17:21.003
Okay, files, files.

1202
01:17:21.155 --> 01:17:22.787
We're talking about symbols.

1203
01:17:23.505 --> 01:17:25.870
Hey! Still radioactive.
Hands off.

1204
01:17:27.034 --> 01:17:28.430
Okay, Cube-brain.

1205
01:17:29.483 --> 01:17:31.536
Any of these look like
the symbols you saw?

1206
01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:33.227
Where did you get these?

1207
01:17:33.228 --> 01:17:34.774
Before I got fired.

1208
01:17:34.777 --> 01:17:37.333
I coached S-7's
scrawny, drooly...

1209
01:17:37.368 --> 01:17:42.398
75 years of alien research
which points to one inescapable fact:

1210
01:17:42.433 --> 01:17:47.026
The Transformers;
they've been here a long, long time.

1211
01:17:47.061 --> 01:17:48.204
How do I know?

1212
01:17:49.103 --> 01:17:51.068
Archaeologists found
these unexplained markings

1213
01:17:51.103 --> 01:17:53.539
and ancient runes
all over the world.

1214
01:17:53.882 --> 01:17:55.897
China, Egypt, Greece.

1215
01:17:56.712 --> 01:17:58.159
Shot at 1932.

1216
01:17:58.501 --> 01:18:00.169
These the symbols
you're seeing in your head?

1217
01:18:00.361 --> 01:18:02.650
- Yeah.
- Same ones over here, right?

1218
01:18:03.364 --> 01:18:07.508
So, tell me, how did they end up
all drawing the same thing?

1219
01:18:08.924 --> 01:18:10.327
Aliens.

1220
01:18:10.328 --> 01:18:12.025
And I think
some of them stayed.

1221
01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:13.115
Check this out.

1222
01:18:13.116 --> 01:18:15.034
Project Black Knife.

1223
01:18:15.366 --> 01:18:19.081
Robots, in disguise.
Hiding here.

1224
01:18:19.364 --> 01:18:20.086
All along.

1225
01:18:20.087 --> 01:18:23.182
We detected radioactive signatures
all across the country.

1226
01:18:23.425 --> 01:18:26.870
I pleaded on my knees
with S-7 to investigate it

1227
01:18:26.890 --> 01:18:30.478
but they said
the readings were infantesimal.

1228
01:18:30.513 --> 01:18:33.173
That I was obsessed!

1229
01:18:33.245 --> 01:18:34.794
Me, can you imagine that?

1230
01:18:35.850 --> 01:18:38.194
Megatron said that there was
another Energon source here.

1231
01:18:38.229 --> 01:18:39.999
- On Earth? On another source?
- On Earth.

1232
01:18:40.196 --> 01:18:41.280
Okay,
and that these symbols,

1233
01:18:41.281 --> 01:18:42.837
the maps in my head
would lead him there.

1234
01:18:43.102 --> 01:18:44.851
Should you talk
to your Autobot friends?

1235
01:18:44.875 --> 01:18:46.122
No, no, no,
the source is before.

1236
01:18:46.123 --> 01:18:48.749
Whatever the Energon source is,
it predates them. It's before them.

1237
01:18:49.023 --> 01:18:50.522
- So it comes before that.
- Correct.

1238
01:18:51.337 --> 01:18:52.751
Well then, report...

1239
01:18:52.752 --> 01:18:54.505
Unless we can talk
to a Decepticon.

1240
01:18:55.017 --> 01:18:57.150
I mean, I'm not on
speed terms or whatever...

1241
01:18:57.179 --> 01:18:58.650
Actually, I am.

1242
01:19:03.232 --> 01:19:04.759
Let me out!

1243
01:19:05.072 --> 01:19:06.934
- It could be a little bit sad.
- Open it.

1244
01:19:08.833 --> 01:19:11.387
I'm gonna so many Decepticons
on your butt!

1245
01:19:11.525 --> 01:19:12.526
Behave.

1246
01:19:12.527 --> 01:19:14.058
- What is it, a Decepticon?
- Yeah.

1247
01:19:14.323 --> 01:19:16.206
- Can you train him?
- Tried to.

1248
01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:19.608
I spent my whole adult life,
coming a plan of aliens.

1249
01:19:19.643 --> 01:19:21.156
- You're very furious...
- And you're carrying it around

1250
01:19:21.186 --> 01:19:22.936
what are you supposed to make
a little chihuahua.

1251
01:19:23.856 --> 01:19:25.979
Wanna throw it down,
you pubic fro-head?

1252
01:19:26.290 --> 01:19:28.994
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry about your eye.

1253
01:19:29.447 --> 01:19:30.866
You know,
but if you're a good boy,

1254
01:19:31.123 --> 01:19:32.885
then I'm not gonna torch
your other eye.

1255
01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:34.256
Okay?
I'm not gonna torch it.

1256
01:19:34.291 --> 01:19:36.264
Just tell me
what these symbols are.

1257
01:19:36.740 --> 01:19:37.872
Please.

1258
01:19:38.956 --> 01:19:40.158
Okay.

1259
01:19:40.973 --> 01:19:43.933
Oh, I know that.
That's the language of the Primes.

1260
01:19:45.299 --> 01:19:47.317
I don't read it, but uh,
these guys...

1261
01:19:47.793 --> 01:19:50.531
Where the frick did you find
photos of these guys?

1262
01:19:50.767 --> 01:19:51.780
- Is this them?
- Yeah.

1263
01:19:51.781 --> 01:19:54.458
Sakers, pal.
Oldest of the old.

1264
01:19:54.567 --> 01:19:56.151
Oh, they've been here for
thousands of years,

1265
01:19:56.181 --> 01:19:57.432
looking for something.

1266
01:19:57.433 --> 01:19:59.252
I don't know what,
nobody tells me nothing.

1267
01:19:59.287 --> 01:20:01.441
Oh, they'll translate
those symbols for ya.

1268
01:20:01.603 --> 01:20:03.103
And I know
where to find them.

1269
01:20:03.138 --> 01:20:04.404
Show us.

1270
01:20:09.009 --> 01:20:10.835
Closest one's
in Washington.

1271
01:20:13.443 --> 01:20:16.300
Smithsonian
Air and Space Museum.

1272
01:20:16.303 --> 01:20:18.640
Land of dreams
in there.

1273
01:20:19.234 --> 01:20:21.174
All I ever want to be
was an astronaut.

1274
01:20:22.973 --> 01:20:24.602
- Hold those.
- What is that?

1275
01:20:25.588 --> 01:20:26.603
What?

1276
01:20:26.604 --> 01:20:28.206
I wear them
when I'm in the funk.

1277
01:20:29.163 --> 01:20:32.191
So does Jeamby, Cheater.
It's a baseball thing.

1278
01:20:32.192 --> 01:20:35.250
Okay. Once you synchronize,
shop-mind and empty bladder

1279
01:20:35.285 --> 01:20:38.303
you get caught, demand an attorney
and don't ever say my name.

1280
01:20:38.338 --> 01:20:39.392
Here, take one
of these pills.

1281
01:20:39.393 --> 01:20:40.121
Slip it
under your tongue,

1282
01:20:40.122 --> 01:20:42.552
it's a high-concentrate polymer
they put in Oreo cookies.

1283
01:20:42.587 --> 01:20:44.384
Fools the polygraph,
everytime.

1284
01:20:44.419 --> 01:20:46.362
Okay, now let's get this show
on the road.

1285
01:20:46.818 --> 01:20:48.766
Whoa, no, listen.
I can't do this.

1286
01:20:48.796 --> 01:20:50.028
I'm not some
alien bounty hunter, alright?

1287
01:20:50.029 --> 01:20:51.353
'cause I'm not gonna do this.
Guards have guns,

1288
01:20:51.384 --> 01:20:53.008
- I don't want to die.
- Kid, kid, kid, kid, kid, kid.

1289
01:20:53.511 --> 01:20:56.157
You compromise this mission,
you are dead to me.

1290
01:20:56.216 --> 01:20:59.387
Now look into my eyes,
and tighten up that spare tank.

1291
01:20:59.767 --> 01:21:01.443
<i>The museum
is now closing.</i>

1292
01:21:01.837 --> 01:21:03.212
Papa, bad news, bro.

1293
01:21:03.253 --> 01:21:05.221
Ran out of toilet paper,
you got any out here?

1294
01:21:05.251 --> 01:21:07.417
- Please tell me you...
- Sir, I suggest you get in there.

1295
01:21:07.452 --> 01:21:08.914
The museum is closed.

1296
01:21:08.949 --> 01:21:11.614
Listen man, I understand that,
but as you can see, this is important.

1297
01:21:11.615 --> 01:21:13.444
Dumper-dumper.
I gotta go, alright?

1298
01:21:13.445 --> 01:21:16.100
Sir, you are a grown naked man
around showing...

1299
01:21:16.401 --> 01:21:19.054
- Pull your pants up and exit...
- I'm not going anywhere.

1300
01:21:23.958 --> 01:21:25.274
You got that paper,
right, sir?

1301
01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:26.598
You should be embarassed.

1302
01:21:26.599 --> 01:21:28.284
This a family museum, sir.

1303
01:21:46.936 --> 01:21:48.556
What is going on here?

1304
01:21:48.591 --> 01:21:50.494
How many times
can you get tased in the nuts?

1305
01:21:50.495 --> 01:21:53.040
So you covered the gates,
huh, you know.

1306
01:21:53.075 --> 01:21:55.528
You're an amateur man,
a rank amateur.

1307
01:21:59.096 --> 01:22:01.014
There's now five guards.
Five guards.

1308
01:22:01.224 --> 01:22:02.657
- You get this stuff and get out of here.
- Give me a second.

1309
01:22:02.953 --> 01:22:04.269
I gotta get
the tracker, alright.

1310
01:22:04.924 --> 01:22:07.163
- Be good.
- I'm claustrophobic.

1311
01:22:24.127 --> 01:22:26.333
Look, look.
Follow him, follow him.

1312
01:22:26.368 --> 01:22:27.687
He knows
where he's going.

1313
01:22:33.074 --> 01:22:34.322
- He knows something.
- What?

1314
01:22:34.323 --> 01:22:36.034
He knows something!

1315
01:22:41.728 --> 01:22:43.013
- You got what I got?
- Yeah.

1316
01:22:43.014 --> 01:22:44.413
Blackbird.

1317
01:22:47.253 --> 01:22:48.766
There he is.

1318
01:22:48.801 --> 01:22:52.635
This guy's a legend,
like...like the Chairman of the Board.

1319
01:22:52.670 --> 01:22:54.399
Yo, freshman,
put the shard.

1320
01:22:54.892 --> 01:22:56.983
And watch
the magic happen.

1321
01:23:04.043 --> 01:23:06.102
Oh shit,
it's a Decepticon!

1322
01:23:06.545 --> 01:23:08.180
- Decepticon?
- What is it?

1323
01:23:08.753 --> 01:23:10.135
Find the main tail!

1324
01:23:22.771 --> 01:23:25.577
What sort of hideous
mosalleem is this?

1325
01:23:27.151 --> 01:23:30.422
Semi pulls and days,
show yourselves!

1326
01:23:30.423 --> 01:23:32.672
Or suffer my infinite wrath!

1327
01:23:34.089 --> 01:23:36.842
W-wait, old spinal called
based organisms.

1328
01:23:38.014 --> 01:23:39.352
Bugger!

1329
01:23:39.929 --> 01:23:44.369
Behold the eternal glory
of Jetfire!

1330
01:23:44.404 --> 01:23:46.518
Prepare
for a systems' override.

1331
01:23:46.553 --> 01:23:48.032
I tell you, this guy
did not age well.

1332
01:23:48.068 --> 01:23:50.926
- He either heard it.
- Command these doors to open.

1333
01:23:51.208 --> 01:23:52.457
Fire!

1334
01:23:52.458 --> 01:23:55.090
Oh, I said, fire!

1335
01:23:56.143 --> 01:23:57.436
Bollocks.

1336
01:23:57.437 --> 01:23:59.563
Break that,
these worthless...

1337
01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:01.307
Wait a second.

1338
01:24:01.308 --> 01:24:04.835
Itching, wretching,
rust in my arse.

1339
01:24:05.326 --> 01:24:08.156
Oh, the museum's gonna be
very angry.

1340
01:24:08.191 --> 01:24:10.507
Very angry.
We gotta catch that plane!

1341
01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:15.680
I'm on a mission.

1342
01:24:16.353 --> 01:24:17.716
- W-wait, wait!
- Wait, wait, wait.

1343
01:24:17.726 --> 01:24:18.914
- Hey!
- What do you want?

1344
01:24:18.915 --> 01:24:20.059
Look,
we just want to talk!

1345
01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:21.918
I've no time to talk,
I'm on a mission!

1346
01:24:21.953 --> 01:24:23.773
I'm a mercenary goon-bringer.

1347
01:24:23.808 --> 01:24:25.857
- What planet am I on?
- Earth.

1348
01:24:25.899 --> 01:24:27.910
Earth?
Terrible name for a planet,

1349
01:24:27.945 --> 01:24:29.904
might as well
call it "dirt".

1350
01:24:29.905 --> 01:24:31.852
Planet dirt.

1351
01:24:31.893 --> 01:24:34.832
Tell me, is that robot civil war
still going on?

1352
01:24:35.397 --> 01:24:36.946
- Who's winning?
- The Decepticons.

1353
01:24:38.001 --> 01:24:40.175
Well, I changed sides
to the Autobots.

1354
01:24:40.210 --> 01:24:41.623
What do you mean,
"changed sides"?

1355
01:24:41.658 --> 01:24:42.635
It's a choice.

1356
01:24:42.636 --> 01:24:46.993
It's intensely personal decision.
So much negativity.

1357
01:24:47.053 --> 01:24:49.105
Who wants to live a life
filled with hate?

1358
01:24:49.139 --> 01:24:50.246
Meaning you don't have
to work for those

1359
01:24:50.247 --> 01:24:51.743
miserable,
freaking Decepticons?

1360
01:24:51.784 --> 01:24:55.155
If they set on their way,
they destroy the whole Universe.

1361
01:24:55.624 --> 01:24:57.943
I'm changing sides,
I'm changing sides, Warrior Goddess!

1362
01:24:58.306 --> 01:25:00.610
- Who's your little Autobot?
- Oh you cutes.

1363
01:25:00.643 --> 01:25:01.910
Name's Wheelie.

1364
01:25:02.033 --> 01:25:03.560
Say my name,
say my name!

1365
01:25:04.150 --> 01:25:05.848
What are you allowing
to happen to your foot just now?

1366
01:25:05.883 --> 01:25:07.149
At least he's faithful, Sam.

1367
01:25:07.150 --> 01:25:09.764
Yeah, well, he's faithful,
and he's nude and he's perverted.

1368
01:25:11.573 --> 01:25:12.845
Can you just...
Can you stop?

1369
01:25:12.846 --> 01:25:15.107
- Hey, what are you doing?
- ...I don't wanna argue it.

1370
01:25:15.141 --> 01:25:16.315
What were you saying?

1371
01:25:16.347 --> 01:25:18.556
I told you
my name was Jetfire!

1372
01:25:20.346 --> 01:25:22.313
Wow, someone shit in the bed
this morning?

1373
01:25:24.547 --> 01:25:26.092
Pretty stout
with my mother.

1374
01:25:26.214 --> 01:25:28.738
My ancestors have been here
for centuries.

1375
01:25:28.774 --> 01:25:31.591
My father, one was a wheel!
The first wheel!

1376
01:25:31.626 --> 01:25:33.640
- Do you know what he transformed into?
- No.

1377
01:25:33.895 --> 01:25:38.845
Nothing!
But he did so with honor, dignity and...

1378
01:25:46.928 --> 01:25:49.317
My boosters are fried.

1379
01:25:50.896 --> 01:25:52.405
I thought
we could help each other.

1380
01:25:52.406 --> 01:25:54.897
You know things I don't know.
I know things you don't know.

1381
01:25:54.898 --> 01:25:56.410
- I do.
- I don't think he knows anything.

1382
01:25:56.445 --> 01:25:58.073
Honestly, I don't know.

1383
01:26:01.227 --> 01:26:02.198
These vivid symbols,

1384
01:26:02.199 --> 01:26:03.868
they're symbols
but they are in my mind.

1385
01:26:03.908 --> 01:26:05.233
You see,
all this is in my mind.

1386
01:26:05.234 --> 01:26:07.206
And Megatron
wants what's in my mind.

1387
01:26:07.207 --> 01:26:08.532
Him and someone called
the Fallen.

1388
01:26:08.533 --> 01:26:12.064
The Fallen? I know him.
He left me here to rust.

1389
01:26:12.100 --> 01:26:13.484
The original Decepticon.

1390
01:26:13.512 --> 01:26:16.951
He's terrible to work for.
He's always apocalypse, chaos...

1391
01:26:17.769 --> 01:26:19.850
His suspects,
they were a part of my mission

1392
01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:21.622
the Fall and Search,
I remember now.

1393
01:26:21.662 --> 01:26:24.229
Of a dagger's tip
and the key!

1394
01:26:24.513 --> 01:26:26.356
Slow down.
The dagger's tip, the key,

1395
01:26:26.391 --> 01:26:27.798
- what are you talking about?
- No time to explain.

1396
01:26:27.799 --> 01:26:29.367
Hold on, everybody!

1397
01:26:57.082 --> 01:26:58.730
Well, that wasn't so bad.

1398
01:26:58.860 --> 01:27:00.606
I was overseeing
the wrong planet.

1399
01:27:00.646 --> 01:27:02.572
Hey, that frickin' hurt!

1400
01:27:04.221 --> 01:27:05.585
Oh, my God!

1401
01:27:12.223 --> 01:27:14.274
Oh, God!

1402
01:27:18.406 --> 01:27:21.770
Oh, my God! You beautiful face,
this will be a perfect moment.

1403
01:27:21.841 --> 01:27:23.827
Except you landed
on my testicles.

1404
01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:25.668
Please get off!

1405
01:27:28.566 --> 01:27:30.025
My balls!

1406
01:27:30.486 --> 01:27:32.073
Sam!

1407
01:27:33.003 --> 01:27:36.283
- Where are we? Simmons!
- Hey! Yeah!

1408
01:27:36.284 --> 01:27:37.920
Oh, my God.

1409
01:27:38.939 --> 01:27:41.263
What is this?
It's Vegas!

1410
01:27:41.298 --> 01:27:42.957
- You guys okay?
- Yeah!

1411
01:27:42.958 --> 01:27:45.864
Hey! I think
we're in Vegas!

1412
01:27:45.865 --> 01:27:47.361
That really, really hurts.

1413
01:27:47.402 --> 01:27:49.625
You're just lucky
that I didn't get hurt.

1414
01:27:49.626 --> 01:27:52.216
People could've gotten killed, okay?
And if I would have gotten hurt,

1415
01:27:52.217 --> 01:27:54.359
- you would have heard from...
- Oh, shut up!

1416
01:27:54.399 --> 01:27:56.175
I told you
I was opening the space bridge.

1417
01:27:56.205 --> 01:27:58.465
It's the fastest way
to travel to Egypt.

1418
01:27:58.466 --> 01:28:00.963
What did you tell us?
You didn't tell us anything!

1419
01:28:01.391 --> 01:28:03.525
You didn't tell us anything.
Why are we in Egypt?

1420
01:28:03.526 --> 01:28:06.218
Don't you dare
slip in with me, fleshwing.

1421
01:28:06.744 --> 01:28:09.131
- You would do the informed.
- Can you just stop for a second?

1422
01:28:09.161 --> 01:28:11.093
Can you focus?
Can you tell us why we're in Egypt

1423
01:28:11.128 --> 01:28:13.797
so we can all have a little bit
assemblance and peace of mind?

1424
01:28:13.798 --> 01:28:17.073
This planet was visited
by our race once before

1425
01:28:17.074 --> 01:28:19.985
by our earliest ancestors
a millenium ago.

1426
01:28:20.020 --> 01:28:23.020
They were on an exploratory mission
to harvest Energon,

1427
01:28:23.055 --> 01:28:25.644
the life blood
of our race.

1428
01:28:25.679 --> 01:28:28.616
Without it, we'll all perish,
oxidize and rust,

1429
01:28:28.651 --> 01:28:30.598
let my wretched self.

1430
01:28:30.633 --> 01:28:34.818
Do you have any idea what is
like a slowly fall of parton die?

1431
01:28:34.854 --> 01:28:37.693
Let's not get episodic, okay?
Old-timer.

1432
01:28:38.145 --> 01:28:43.588
Beginning, middle, end.
Facts, details, condense, plot, tell it.

1433
01:28:43.589 --> 01:28:48.571
Somewhere buried in this desert,
our ancestors built a great machine.

1434
01:28:48.742 --> 01:28:52.843
It harvests Energon
by destroying suns.

1435
01:28:52.953 --> 01:28:54.686
- Destroy suns?
- You mean blow them up?

1436
01:28:54.706 --> 01:28:58.357
Yes. You see, in the beginning,
there were seven Primes,

1437
01:28:58.397 --> 01:29:00.049
our original leaders.

1438
01:29:00.100 --> 01:29:04.064
And they set out in the Universe
seeking distant suns to harvest.

1439
01:29:04.655 --> 01:29:06.962
The Primes set out
with one rule:

1440
01:29:06.963 --> 01:29:10.110
Never destroy a planet
with life.

1441
01:29:10.111 --> 01:29:13.207
Until one of them
tried to defy this rule.

1442
01:29:13.242 --> 01:29:17.457
And his name, for ever more,
was the Fallen.

1443
01:29:19.167 --> 01:29:21.507
He despised
the human race.

1444
01:29:22.634 --> 01:29:26.716
And he wanted to kill you all
by turning on that machine.

1445
01:29:26.751 --> 01:29:31.151
The only way to activate it
is with a legendary key

1446
01:29:31.152 --> 01:29:34.281
called the Matrix of Leadership.

1447
01:29:40.548 --> 01:29:45.038
A great battle took place
over possession of the Matrix.

1448
01:29:49.423 --> 01:29:52.012
The Fallen who was
stronger at his will did,

1449
01:29:53.167 --> 01:29:58.160
surrendered no choice,
but to steal and hide it from him.

1450
01:29:58.645 --> 01:30:03.470
In the ultimate sacrifice, they gave
their lives to seal the Matrix away

1451
01:30:03.505 --> 01:30:06.800
in a tomb made of
their very own bodies.

1452
01:30:07.420 --> 01:30:10.414
A tomb
we cannot find.

1453
01:30:11.724 --> 01:30:14.629
Somewhere,
buried in this desert,

1454
01:30:14.665 --> 01:30:17.267
that deadly machine
remains.

1455
01:30:17.303 --> 01:30:19.500
The Fallen knows
where it is.

1456
01:30:19.535 --> 01:30:25.378
And if he finds the Tomb of the Primes,
your world will be no more.

1457
01:30:25.660 --> 01:30:27.158
Okay so how do we stop it?

1458
01:30:27.193 --> 01:30:29.339
Only a Prime
can defeat the Fallen.

1459
01:30:29.876 --> 01:30:31.445
Optimus Prime?

1460
01:30:33.785 --> 01:30:35.870
So you met a Prime?

1461
01:30:36.488 --> 01:30:39.032
You must have met
a great descendant.

1462
01:30:39.067 --> 01:30:40.235
Is he alive?

1463
01:30:40.236 --> 01:30:42.545
Here?
On this planet?

1464
01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:45.109
He sacrificed himself
to save me.

1465
01:30:45.846 --> 01:30:47.267
So he's dead.

1466
01:30:47.268 --> 01:30:49.135
Without a Prime,
it's impossible.

1467
01:30:49.436 --> 01:30:51.546
No one else
could stop the Fallen.

1468
01:30:51.582 --> 01:30:54.743
So the same energy that's going
to be used to reactivate the machine...

1469
01:30:55.475 --> 01:30:58.445
Could that energy somehow be used
to reactivate Optimus

1470
01:30:58.481 --> 01:30:59.482
and bring him
back to life?

1471
01:30:59.483 --> 01:31:01.493
It was never designed
for that purpose,

1472
01:31:01.529 --> 01:31:04.232
but it's an energy,
like no other.

1473
01:31:04.424 --> 01:31:08.363
So then how do you get us to the Matrix
before the Decepticons get to me?

1474
01:31:08.398 --> 01:31:11.676
Follow your mind, your map,
your symbols,

1475
01:31:11.711 --> 01:31:14.322
what you got in the sand,
it's your bloom.

1476
01:31:14.357 --> 01:31:16.580
When dawn alights
the Dagger's tip,

1477
01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:19.413
three kings will reveal
the doorway.

1478
01:31:19.447 --> 01:31:21.566
Find the doorway!

1479
01:31:21.601 --> 01:31:23.101
Go now, go!

1480
01:31:23.354 --> 01:31:26.325
That was my mission.
It's your mission now.

1481
01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:28.870
Go before
the Decepticons find me

1482
01:31:28.990 --> 01:31:30.877
and find you.

1483
01:31:37.201 --> 01:31:38.579
That was
my CIA contact.

1484
01:31:38.619 --> 01:31:41.039
Says Ancient Sumerian used to call
the Gulf of Aqaba

1485
01:31:41.089 --> 01:31:43.292
- the Dagger's Tip.
- That's the dagger's tip.

1486
01:31:43.327 --> 01:31:44.507
- It's part of the Red Sea.
- Got it.

1487
01:31:44.508 --> 01:31:46.714
It divides Egypt and Jordan
like the tip of a blade.

1488
01:31:46.749 --> 01:31:49.406
29 and a half degrees North.
35 East.

1489
01:31:49.841 --> 01:31:50.851
There it is.

1490
01:31:50.852 --> 01:31:53.038
Okay, first thing we gotta do
is get Optimus to Dagger's Tip.

1491
01:31:53.074 --> 01:31:54.671
How are you gonna get him
halfway around the world?

1492
01:31:55.484 --> 01:31:56.875
We're gonna make a call.

1493
01:31:59.720 --> 01:32:01.121
We got the cops.

1494
01:32:07.140 --> 01:32:08.758
I can't go to prison, guys!

1495
01:32:12.223 --> 01:32:14.873
Sam, you gotta get off
this road and lay low.

1496
01:32:25.468 --> 01:32:27.397
Man, they'll pick up.

1497
01:32:27.432 --> 01:32:29.679
This is just called
blending in like a ninja.

1498
01:32:29.851 --> 01:32:31.541
How about I'll lay my piss
in your face?

1499
01:32:32.544 --> 01:32:33.810
They're gone.

1500
01:32:34.043 --> 01:32:35.193
Wait another time.

1501
01:32:35.194 --> 01:32:36.369
How are you gonna make
the call to Lennox?

1502
01:32:36.370 --> 01:32:38.828
You are in the worldwide. What,
they're gonna tranquil in one base?

1503
01:32:38.863 --> 01:32:40.311
They'll track you here
in seconds.

1504
01:32:40.312 --> 01:32:42.266
CIA is all over this place.

1505
01:32:42.278 --> 01:32:43.742
You're gonna call?

1506
01:32:48.530 --> 01:32:50.503
Okay,
that's...that's a good idea.

1507
01:32:50.504 --> 01:32:52.153
- Alright?
- I mean I just was...

1508
01:32:52.623 --> 01:32:53.757
My mind in other things.

1509
01:32:53.758 --> 01:32:55.368
Like why don't you get
being chipped in prison.

1510
01:32:56.235 --> 01:32:57.583
New Jersey

1511
01:32:57.624 --> 01:33:00.258
<i>This departure:
2100 hours.</i>

1512
01:33:01.792 --> 01:33:03.177
So we're shipped in
back to base.

1513
01:33:03.972 --> 01:33:05.398
This is central at stake.

1514
01:33:10.790 --> 01:33:13.022
Major Lennox, phone call.

1515
01:33:13.747 --> 01:33:15.657
Lennox, I'm with the kid.
The kid, you know?

1516
01:33:15.922 --> 01:33:16.963
One with the attitude break?

1517
01:33:16.964 --> 01:33:18.503
I need the truck.
The truck.

1518
01:33:18.538 --> 01:33:21.261
We got a possible resurrection
going on over here.

1519
01:33:21.295 --> 01:33:22.421
You're not gonna believe
where we are.

1520
01:33:22.422 --> 01:33:25.551
Code Tot,
as in King Tutankhamen,

1521
01:33:25.582 --> 01:33:27.252
back of a $1 bill.

1522
01:33:27.671 --> 01:33:32.506
Coordinates for air-drop,
29.5 North, 34.88 East.

1523
01:33:32.540 --> 01:33:34.208
Get it.
Write it down, write it.

1524
01:33:34.209 --> 01:33:35.211
Oh, my God.

1525
01:33:35.212 --> 01:33:36.698
I gotta go, okay.
I hate the cops.

1526
01:33:36.699 --> 01:33:38.411
W-Wait, who are you?

1527
01:33:39.497 --> 01:33:42.035
Wait, it's me.
Leo, me, Leo, Leo. Leo.

1528
01:33:42.138 --> 01:33:43.451
The cops are coming right now.
We need to go.

1529
01:33:46.519 --> 01:33:50.056
Coordinates
29.5 North, 34.88 East.

1530
01:33:50.057 --> 01:33:52.479
Tip of the Red Sea,
Gulf of Aqaba.

1531
01:33:52.962 --> 01:33:54.328
Egypt.

1532
01:33:54.497 --> 01:33:56.091
Are you serious?

1533
01:33:57.040 --> 01:33:58.120
Sir.

1534
01:34:02.404 --> 01:34:05.192
Even if we could figure out a way
to get big man over there.

1535
01:34:05.193 --> 01:34:07.820
How is this little kid's
supposed to bring him back to life?

1536
01:34:08.735 --> 01:34:10.070
I don't know.

1537
01:34:10.145 --> 01:34:11.553
But we gotta trust him.

1538
01:34:13.576 --> 01:34:14.991
Okay, let's go
over it again.

1539
01:34:14.992 --> 01:34:17.446
- When the dawn arise...
- When the dawn arise the dagger's tip,

1540
01:34:17.484 --> 01:34:19.562
- the three kings...
- ...will reveal the doorway.

1541
01:34:19.597 --> 01:34:21.339
That's what he said.
You know what that means?

1542
01:34:21.530 --> 01:34:23.248
- No, what does it mean?
- I have no idea.

1543
01:34:23.249 --> 01:34:25.122
Oh my God, oh my God.
Checkpoint, checkpoint.

1544
01:34:25.156 --> 01:34:26.698
I don't have
my passport.

1545
01:34:28.497 --> 01:34:32.992
Passport.
Idiota (Idiot)!

1546
01:34:37.406 --> 01:34:39.150
They have cams at top.

1547
01:34:40.832 --> 01:34:42.562
He's the one
that they want.

1548
01:34:43.331 --> 01:34:45.390
Alright, chill.
Let's be nice to them.

1549
01:34:46.004 --> 01:34:47.673
I can handle it.
These are my people.

1550
01:34:47.834 --> 01:34:49.735
- Yeah.
- I'm 136.

1551
01:34:52.230 --> 01:34:53.859
Oh great, a frickin' munchkin.

1552
01:34:53.894 --> 01:34:56.277
Oh, little people are mean.
Tell him he's tall.

1553
01:35:01.509 --> 01:35:05.329
- What do you want?
- I want to go to...

1554
01:35:05.405 --> 01:35:08.225
The Dagger's Tip, right?

1555
01:35:08.226 --> 01:35:10.866
Egypt, Jordan.
We wanna go there.

1556
01:35:10.867 --> 01:35:12.878
Me and my family.
This is my family.

1557
01:35:12.879 --> 01:35:14.924
- This is my son, my other son.
- Hi there.

1558
01:35:14.959 --> 01:35:15.812
My daughter.

1559
01:35:15.813 --> 01:35:17.964
We're tourists
from New York.

1560
01:35:18.086 --> 01:35:19.692
- New York?
- Yes. Yes.

1561
01:35:20.053 --> 01:35:21.194
50 kilometres.

1562
01:35:21.195 --> 01:35:22.592
We're going to get one
of your falafels, thank you!

1563
01:35:22.627 --> 01:35:23.621
Yeah,
thank you very much.

1564
01:35:23.622 --> 01:35:25.585
- New York.
- I know, I know you from somewhere.

1565
01:35:26.100 --> 01:35:27.663
No, we do not work
for the CIA.

1566
01:35:32.121 --> 01:35:35.634
<i>Decepticons,
voice location.</i>

1567
01:35:35.828 --> 01:35:37.320
<i>Detected.</i>

1568
01:35:38.143 --> 01:35:41.293
Starscream in pursuit.

1569
01:35:45.646 --> 01:35:48.632
Undercover, yo, you gotta blend in
with your surrounding.

1570
01:35:48.662 --> 01:35:50.904
You know, you gotta be
part of the landscape.

1571
01:35:59.190 --> 01:36:00.405
Awesome.

1572
01:36:00.973 --> 01:36:02.688
I think
aliens built that.

1573
01:36:02.808 --> 01:36:04.250
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1574
01:36:04.251 --> 01:36:05.728
Go, move it!
Move it.

1575
01:36:06.453 --> 01:36:07.444
- What?
- Hey, guard us.

1576
01:36:07.445 --> 01:36:08.780
Low-profile,
don't make a scene, okay?

1577
01:36:08.815 --> 01:36:10.220
Yeah, some of us
got work to do!

1578
01:36:10.549 --> 01:36:12.322
Dumb Autobots.

1579
01:36:15.244 --> 01:36:18.442
NEST, 0600 AM
Estimated time of detachment

1580
01:36:33.225 --> 01:36:35.268
Being my girlfriend
is hazardous to your health.

1581
01:36:37.017 --> 01:36:41.407
Yeah, well,
girls like dangerous boys.

1582
01:36:41.883 --> 01:36:43.232
- Really?
- Yeah.

1583
01:36:46.098 --> 01:36:47.727
Why don't you say it?

1584
01:36:48.471 --> 01:36:50.054
Ladies first.

1585
01:36:51.262 --> 01:36:53.575
Okay, so tonight,
you're gonna be a gentleman.

1586
01:36:54.093 --> 01:36:55.455
You're really chivalrous.

1587
01:36:55.825 --> 01:36:57.281
Why are you mad at me?

1588
01:36:57.367 --> 01:36:59.406
You know what?
Baby, I'm not...

1589
01:36:59.808 --> 01:37:01.294
I'm not mad.

1590
01:37:01.947 --> 01:37:06.362
You realise that I just flew 3,000 miles
to keep you from getting killed.

1591
01:37:06.522 --> 01:37:07.839
I know.

1592
01:37:10.973 --> 01:37:12.835
Who else could be
your girlfriend too?

1593
01:37:13.778 --> 01:37:15.830
Look at the things
that go through with me.

1594
01:37:17.088 --> 01:37:19.505
And now we're underneath
the moon and the stars

1595
01:37:19.540 --> 01:37:21.836
and the three most beautiful
pyramids on the planet

1596
01:37:21.877 --> 01:37:23.932
and you still can't even tell me
that you love me.

1597
01:37:27.613 --> 01:37:28.620
- What?
- Wait.

1598
01:37:28.621 --> 01:37:31.230
- Why do boys always change the subject?
- The moon and the stars...

1599
01:37:31.265 --> 01:37:33.028
- Sam...
- Come with me really quick.

1600
01:37:40.889 --> 01:37:42.961
Simmons, Leo,
wake up!

1601
01:37:46.275 --> 01:37:48.522
Listen, Astronomy class, page 47,
you remember the class?

1602
01:37:48.557 --> 01:37:51.153
No, no, I was only in college
for two days, you remember that?

1603
01:37:51.188 --> 01:37:53.165
- Yeah, well, get up. Up, up.
- What are you talking about?

1604
01:37:58.840 --> 01:37:59.942
Can you see
those three stars?

1605
01:37:59.943 --> 01:38:01.655
You see how the last one
touches the horizon?

1606
01:38:01.979 --> 01:38:03.348
That's Orion's belt.

1607
01:38:03.349 --> 01:38:05.631
It's also called the Three Kings
and the reason for that is

1608
01:38:05.666 --> 01:38:08.397
the three Egyptian kings who built
the pyramids in Giza built them

1609
01:38:08.433 --> 01:38:09.609
to mear those stars.

1610
01:38:09.610 --> 01:38:11.402
So it's like an aerial staring
straight in the face.

1611
01:38:11.434 --> 01:38:13.222
They all point due East
towards Jordan.

1612
01:38:13.553 --> 01:38:14.854
The mountains of Petra.

1613
01:38:28.054 --> 01:38:32.062
<i>We got a seatbelt malfunction.
We gotta have to divert...</i>

1614
01:38:32.063 --> 01:38:33.689
<i>Flight in lower,
prepare for bail-out.</i>

1615
01:38:33.835 --> 01:38:36.050
Bail-out, bail-out,
bail-out, bail-out?

1616
01:38:36.085 --> 01:38:38.235
Alright, team,
grab your shoots.

1617
01:38:38.270 --> 01:38:39.534
Bail-out?

1618
01:38:41.588 --> 01:38:43.227
Familiar with the standard
MC-4?

1619
01:38:43.462 --> 01:38:46.275
Of course not. I've never jumped out
of a publicly good airplane before.

1620
01:38:46.509 --> 01:38:47.880
Wait a minute,
is this really happening?

1621
01:38:47.881 --> 01:38:48.796
Yeah.

1622
01:38:50.924 --> 01:38:52.388
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1623
01:38:52.868 --> 01:38:54.272
You're behind this,
aren't you?

1624
01:38:54.476 --> 01:38:55.476
What are you talking about?

1625
01:38:55.477 --> 01:38:57.572
You heard the pilot.
These guys don't mess around.

1626
01:38:58.768 --> 01:39:01.776
This is standard procedure.
I'm just following orders to the letter.

1627
01:39:01.811 --> 01:39:03.519
Do you know
what you said?

1628
01:39:04.060 --> 01:39:06.450
You, just find the captain
and your career...

1629
01:39:12.030 --> 01:39:13.400
Wait, what was that?
What's that?

1630
01:39:13.401 --> 01:39:14.948
That's not good.

1631
01:39:14.964 --> 01:39:17.238
Come on.
Right this way, right this way!

1632
01:39:17.278 --> 01:39:18.500
I can't jump
out of an airplane.

1633
01:39:23.397 --> 01:39:25.669
Come here.
Come here.

1634
01:39:26.874 --> 01:39:29.675
Because I have to secure
the VIPs first.

1635
01:39:29.676 --> 01:39:32.021
Okay, I want you
to listen very carefully.

1636
01:39:32.022 --> 01:39:33.850
Remember as everything
that I say.

1637
01:39:34.091 --> 01:39:37.339
East to the GPS trackers, so
you can be found by search and rescue.

1638
01:39:41.558 --> 01:39:42.945
- Look, are you listening?
- I can't.

1639
01:39:44.238 --> 01:39:45.892
- Alright, alright.
- Alright.

1640
01:39:45.976 --> 01:39:47.825
When the plane that shoot
inflates into the air,

1641
01:39:47.826 --> 01:39:49.928
pull the pin
and open some air,

1642
01:39:49.988 --> 01:39:52.195
break your rack up,
lose your primary.

1643
01:39:52.387 --> 01:39:53.699
I want you
to pull the blue.

1644
01:39:53.820 --> 01:39:55.564
I need you to pull it
really hard.

1645
01:39:56.358 --> 01:39:58.932
Not right now.
We're on the plane, you dumbass!

1646
01:40:02.251 --> 01:40:03.365
Did he say goodbye?

1647
01:40:03.366 --> 01:40:05.077
No, he didn't even
say goodbye.

1648
01:40:05.599 --> 01:40:07.248
<i>General,
we're loaded and ready.</i>

1649
01:40:07.467 --> 01:40:10.326
<i>You give us the go, and we'll be ready
to press in five minutes.</i>

1650
01:40:10.543 --> 01:40:11.612
- Excellent.
- Sir,

1651
01:40:11.613 --> 01:40:13.382
you need to see this.
Now.

1652
01:40:15.979 --> 01:40:17.641
Have we checked
these coordinates?

1653
01:40:17.676 --> 01:40:19.086
Egypt, sir.
They're air-dropping in.

1654
01:40:19.106 --> 01:40:20.412
You gotta be kidding me.

1655
01:40:20.967 --> 01:40:22.312
He knows something.

1656
01:40:22.313 --> 01:40:25.179
We need to be ready to back him up,
if this thing goes hot.

1657
01:40:26.047 --> 01:40:27.296
Copy that.

1658
01:40:27.322 --> 01:40:29.481
CIA just got a hit
on the boy.

1659
01:40:30.534 --> 01:40:32.603
Hundred miles from the location
on that little map there.

1660
01:40:32.604 --> 01:40:33.909
It's getting hotter.

1661
01:40:38.091 --> 01:40:40.520
It's gotta be...
around here somewhere.

1662
01:41:21.189 --> 01:41:22.482
It's here somewhere,
guys.

1663
01:41:22.483 --> 01:41:23.736
Oh yeah, why?

1664
01:41:23.737 --> 01:41:25.490
'Cause we're trusting
Grandpa Blackbird

1665
01:41:25.525 --> 01:41:26.876
who doesn't even know
what planet he's on.

1666
01:41:26.946 --> 01:41:29.415
On his defense,
this is the biggest doorway

1667
01:41:29.450 --> 01:41:31.134
I've ever seen
in my entire life.

1668
01:41:31.839 --> 01:41:34.554
Okay. Well, that's great.
Let me do a quick search, alright?

1669
01:41:35.245 --> 01:41:36.069
Nope.

1670
01:41:36.070 --> 01:41:38.675
Ever questioned mind, guys, that
archaeologists have been here before.

1671
01:41:38.710 --> 01:41:39.669
There's nothing here.

1672
01:41:39.670 --> 01:41:42.000
You realise it's heart-break,
despair, kid.

1673
01:41:42.222 --> 01:41:44.376
Sometimes, you get
to the end of the rainbow

1674
01:41:44.416 --> 01:41:46.580
and the leprechauns went
and booby-trapped it.

1675
01:41:46.611 --> 01:41:48.286
I'm listening to you;
you live with your mother.

1676
01:41:50.023 --> 01:41:52.396
- It's not over.
- It is over. It's done.

1677
01:41:52.431 --> 01:41:54.043
Why are we still listening
to your little punk-ass?

1678
01:41:54.078 --> 01:41:56.178
I mean, what kind of dumbfucks
accept ding my rim?

1679
01:41:56.214 --> 01:41:58.216
Kill Megatron.
How about that?

1680
01:41:58.251 --> 01:41:59.862
Well, he doesn't get the job done,
you know, I mean,

1681
01:41:59.893 --> 01:42:01.786
- 'cause he's zapped, man.
- You scared?

1682
01:42:01.807 --> 01:42:03.672
Well, scared?
Scared of your ugly face.

1683
01:42:03.969 --> 01:42:06.552
I'm ugly?
Well, we twins, you stupid genius.

1684
01:42:13.555 --> 01:42:15.395
Guys!
Oh, hey!

1685
01:42:15.999 --> 01:42:17.173
You like
the way that feels?

1686
01:42:17.174 --> 01:42:18.782
- That ain't hurt.
- You got that, don't you?

1687
01:42:18.817 --> 01:42:20.105
I'm getting up...

1688
01:42:28.622 --> 01:42:30.299
Now that's rude.

1689
01:42:41.159 --> 01:42:43.469
Oh, my God!
The symbols.

1690
01:42:44.583 --> 01:42:46.210
Bee!
Shoot it.

1691
01:43:16.488 --> 01:43:17.434
Wow!

1692
01:43:17.435 --> 01:43:19.263
This is the part
which they found silicon.

1693
01:43:20.343 --> 01:43:21.919
The Tomb of the Primes.

1694
01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:41.915
The Matrix.

1695
01:44:05.568 --> 01:44:07.881
Thousands of years
turned to dust.

1696
01:44:08.554 --> 01:44:10.209
This isn't how
it's supposed to end.

1697
01:44:10.879 --> 01:44:12.296
Hear that?

1698
01:44:16.271 --> 01:44:19.019
US Air Force. C-17s.

1699
01:44:20.311 --> 01:44:22.839
You can't bring it back, Sam,
there's nothing left.

1700
01:44:23.093 --> 01:44:25.064
Look, look around you.

1701
01:44:25.323 --> 01:44:27.990
We didn't just go through everything
we went through for no reason at all.

1702
01:44:28.026 --> 01:44:29.429
They just haven't
end like this.

1703
01:44:29.445 --> 01:44:31.292
There is a reason
that we're here.

1704
01:44:31.327 --> 01:44:33.717
The voices and the symbols
in my head led us here...

1705
01:44:33.718 --> 01:44:35.440
for a purpose.

1706
01:44:40.853 --> 01:44:42.928
Everyone's after me
because of what I know.

1707
01:44:45.252 --> 01:44:48.329
And what I know,
is that this is going to work.

1708
01:44:48.980 --> 01:44:50.640
How do you know
it's going to work?

1709
01:44:50.675 --> 01:44:52.171
Because I believe it.

1710
01:45:02.679 --> 01:45:04.713
Best put me out
of this plane.

1711
01:45:15.341 --> 01:45:18.115
He's dropping the big one.
Sam!

1712
01:45:25.667 --> 01:45:27.792
You think you can bring him
back to life with that pixie dust?

1713
01:45:27.827 --> 01:45:29.571
Absolutely.
Let's go!

1714
01:45:39.377 --> 01:45:40.562
Go!

1715
01:45:41.735 --> 01:45:42.867
Move it!

1716
01:45:43.049 --> 01:45:44.372
Remember your friendly!

1717
01:45:54.818 --> 01:45:56.476
Cover Optimus!

1718
01:45:59.256 --> 01:46:01.302
Secure the village.
Get those cases down here.

1719
01:46:01.303 --> 01:46:03.386
Get snipers and Stingers
up high.

1720
01:46:03.901 --> 01:46:06.163
So he just dropped off
ten tonnes of dead robot

1721
01:46:06.183 --> 01:46:07.738
in the middle of nowhere.

1722
01:46:07.813 --> 01:46:09.613
Hope this little kid
know what he's doing.

1723
01:46:09.648 --> 01:46:11.113
Yeah, me too.

1724
01:46:16.580 --> 01:46:19.975
Got a visual!
Yellow tee, four klicks.

1725
01:46:23.118 --> 01:46:24.762
Hot-flare!

1726
01:46:26.830 --> 01:46:28.640
That's them right there.
You see the flare?

1727
01:46:28.689 --> 01:46:30.205
Right over there!
See it?

1728
01:46:31.042 --> 01:46:33.104
The boy has been found.

1729
01:46:40.564 --> 01:46:41.882
Sam!

1730
01:46:53.918 --> 01:46:55.417
Oh God, please God,

1731
01:46:55.446 --> 01:46:56.633
- please!
- Leo, stop freaking out.

1732
01:46:56.634 --> 01:46:58.928
- Just stop freaking out!
- Just drop this guy off, huh?

1733
01:46:58.963 --> 01:47:00.584
- Please let me live, just let me live.
- Stop freaking out!

1734
01:47:00.905 --> 01:47:02.450
Just stop screaming
right now. That's it.

1735
01:47:05.079 --> 01:47:07.008
Can't take that guy
anymore.

1736
01:47:29.229 --> 01:47:30.403
We gotta split up.

1737
01:47:30.404 --> 01:47:33.101
Bumblebee, you are the decoy.
You lead the Decepticons away, alright?

1738
01:47:33.426 --> 01:47:34.460
I'm gonna get Optimus.

1739
01:47:34.461 --> 01:47:36.486
I'll help throw their fire away.

1740
01:47:36.866 --> 01:47:38.377
You get to those soldiers.

1741
01:47:40.118 --> 01:47:41.592
I hope
that dust works, kid.

1742
01:47:42.022 --> 01:47:43.464
Thank you.

1743
01:47:46.977 --> 01:47:48.444
It's turning around.

1744
01:47:48.929 --> 01:47:50.270
It's coming back,
it's coming back.

1745
01:47:51.234 --> 01:47:52.443
It's up to me.

1746
01:47:52.444 --> 01:47:55.381
One man, alone, betrayed
by the country he loves,

1747
01:47:55.415 --> 01:47:57.880
now its last hope
in the final hour of need.

1748
01:47:57.881 --> 01:48:00.441
The pants are to be driven
like never before.

1749
01:48:00.442 --> 01:48:01.741
Under my skin.

1750
01:48:01.742 --> 01:48:03.576
Hey, hey, hey!
Don't go nowhere.

1751
01:48:03.611 --> 01:48:05.663
- Drive!
- You will never make it, kid.

1752
01:48:05.698 --> 01:48:07.341
Bravery will only get you
so far.

1753
01:48:07.377 --> 01:48:09.984
You tased me, okay?
You owe me.

1754
01:48:10.020 --> 01:48:11.230
- I'm go.
- Okay, okay.

1755
01:48:11.231 --> 01:48:12.552
That was a test.
You passed, alright?

1756
01:48:20.255 --> 01:48:22.471
Thing's got alien tattoos
all over.

1757
01:48:22.869 --> 01:48:24.605
That ain't Air Force.

1758
01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:29.222
What the hell was that?

1759
01:48:29.257 --> 01:48:30.998
- Eddy-1, copy.
- Anyone there?

1760
01:48:31.034 --> 01:48:31.744
Who's up?

1761
01:48:31.745 --> 01:48:33.168
- Copy.
- Radio's down.

1762
01:48:33.204 --> 01:48:34.639
It's dead.
Counter that.

1763
01:48:34.669 --> 01:48:36.214
EMP-burst.

1764
01:48:36.432 --> 01:48:39.341
Let's see how this day is going
in this godforsaken desert.

1765
01:48:41.330 --> 01:48:42.159
Yes, sir.

1766
01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:44.141
<i>Major Lennox told me
to pull the cord.</i>

1767
01:48:44.176 --> 01:48:45.262
I know, sir.

1768
01:48:45.263 --> 01:48:47.606
W-Which, what country
am I in right now?

1769
01:48:47.607 --> 01:48:48.963
United States.

1770
01:48:49.455 --> 01:48:53.146
No, no, not the United States.
I'm from the United States,

1771
01:48:53.186 --> 01:48:55.296
<i>I'm in the middle of nowhere,
surrounded by goats.</i>

1772
01:48:56.072 --> 01:48:58.733
Well, that was
our good friend, Galloway.

1773
01:48:58.734 --> 01:49:00.604
He's less than pleased.

1774
01:49:00.938 --> 01:49:03.577
How is it that
we can't reach our men,

1775
01:49:03.617 --> 01:49:09.361
but he can reach me
from some random Egyptian desert?

1776
01:49:13.143 --> 01:49:14.265
Nothing.

1777
01:49:14.622 --> 01:49:17.681
Mike, put an SOS, let the eye in the sky
know we need some help.

1778
01:49:17.716 --> 01:49:18.881
Yes, sir.

1779
01:49:20.303 --> 01:49:22.736
Pop some more flares
so that the kid can find us.

1780
01:49:29.843 --> 01:49:32.010
There he is.
We got a couple of miles.

1781
01:49:32.429 --> 01:49:36.952
Lennox's team has the latest
in quantum crypto gear.

1782
01:49:36.993 --> 01:49:42.929
Can somebody tell me why we can't
establish simple radio contact?

1783
01:49:42.930 --> 01:49:45.304
We're hailing them on every frequency
and mode in the book, sir.

1784
01:49:45.655 --> 01:49:47.049
Our satellites in the area
have gone blind.

1785
01:49:47.084 --> 01:49:48.208
We're working it, sir.

1786
01:49:48.209 --> 01:49:49.410
Dammit.

1787
01:49:49.411 --> 01:49:51.963
Something's not right,
it doesn't add up.

1788
01:49:51.998 --> 01:49:55.302
Contact the Jordanians, see what
their assets they've got in the area.

1789
01:49:55.303 --> 01:49:57.691
And get Egypt's
General Salaam,

1790
01:49:57.732 --> 01:50:01.835
ask him to clear some US
V over-flights in Egyptian airspace.

1791
01:50:01.870 --> 01:50:04.866
We need an assist
in confirming visuals now.

1792
01:50:05.104 --> 01:50:06.527
Scramble predators now.

1793
01:50:06.869 --> 01:50:08.320
B-1, rotate.

1794
01:50:20.243 --> 01:50:21.910
East on the mile
that way.

1795
01:50:27.814 --> 01:50:28.904
Come here.

1796
01:50:31.992 --> 01:50:33.294
This way.

1797
01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:41.799
- One man... alone...
- Stop saying that.

1798
01:50:41.834 --> 01:50:43.750
- betrayed by the country he loves.
- Oh my goodness,

1799
01:50:43.779 --> 01:50:45.669
I'm in the car, okay?
You're not alone.

1800
01:50:46.111 --> 01:50:47.902
Just relax,
you're looking nice well.

1801
01:50:57.090 --> 01:50:58.717
I-I don't think
he's still following us.

1802
01:51:00.184 --> 01:51:01.856
That's what you think.

1803
01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:22.533
Master, sorry to be
the bearer of bad news,

1804
01:51:22.568 --> 01:51:25.553
but the soldiers brought
the body of Prime.

1805
01:51:25.845 --> 01:51:28.125
The boy must have
the Matrix.

1806
01:51:28.506 --> 01:51:31.111
We cannot let him
reach Optimus.

1807
01:51:31.636 --> 01:51:33.469
Decepticons!

1808
01:51:33.632 --> 01:51:35.412
Begin our assault!

1809
01:51:36.298 --> 01:51:37.656
We got incoming!

1810
01:51:53.944 --> 01:51:56.108
We got a whole load of
flight coming our way!

1811
01:51:56.861 --> 01:51:58.742
- How many?
- We got 13 to count.

1812
01:51:59.198 --> 01:52:01.808
This ain't good.
This ain't good.

1813
01:52:09.924 --> 01:52:12.119
We 'bout to get
our asses whooped.

1814
01:52:14.955 --> 01:52:17.652
Alright, those Decepticons
are searching for Sam.

1815
01:52:19.351 --> 01:52:22.196
Whatever he has, he thinks
it'll bring Optimus back to life.

1816
01:52:22.231 --> 01:52:25.353
So our mission is to find him
and get him to Optimus.

1817
01:52:25.415 --> 01:52:27.252
Alright, we're gonna draw
fire from the left flag.

1818
01:52:27.314 --> 01:52:28.801
I need a scout team.

1819
01:52:29.172 --> 01:52:31.213
We'll walk through the middle
with Arcee and Ironhide.

1820
01:52:31.794 --> 01:52:33.322
Alright, when you see
the precious cargo,

1821
01:52:33.371 --> 01:52:36.301
I want you to pop green smoke
and come back to those pillars.

1822
01:52:36.341 --> 01:52:37.899
We'll have
the ambush set.

1823
01:52:37.900 --> 01:52:39.299
Alright, let's go,
move out!

1824
01:52:39.300 --> 01:52:40.436
- Move out!
- Move out!

1825
01:52:48.694 --> 01:52:50.867
Did you see that film
Gunfire Aero-Kay Karao?

1826
01:52:52.906 --> 01:52:56.021
- Casting Kirk Douglas.
- No, why?

1827
01:52:59.102 --> 01:53:00.508
Looks like we're right
in the middle of it.

1828
01:53:00.948 --> 01:53:02.266
Is that good?

1829
01:53:04.229 --> 01:53:05.595
Lot of people died.

1830
01:53:22.102 --> 01:53:24.764
- Oh, oh, oh...
- Hide!

1831
01:53:27.058 --> 01:53:28.695
Oh my God!

1832
01:53:50.353 --> 01:53:51.965
Sam, Sam.

1833
01:53:55.374 --> 01:53:56.831
Get down, get down.

1834
01:54:01.001 --> 01:54:02.328
Once, it's clear,
we'll run for Optimus

1835
01:54:02.329 --> 01:54:03.698
as fast we can, okay?

1836
01:54:05.534 --> 01:54:07.226
And what if
it doesn't work?

1837
01:54:07.874 --> 01:54:09.289
This will work.

1838
01:54:09.402 --> 01:54:11.231
- Yeah, but what if it doesn't?
- It's gonna work.

1839
01:54:11.854 --> 01:54:13.259
It'll work.

1840
01:56:00.509 --> 01:56:02.074
Radio shell.

1841
01:56:20.948 --> 01:56:22.286
We got a half a mile.

1842
01:56:22.287 --> 01:56:23.771
I don't think
the soldiers know we're here.

1843
01:56:26.565 --> 01:56:27.734
Fall back!

1844
01:56:27.841 --> 01:56:29.398
Ironhide, up for middle.

1845
01:56:29.737 --> 01:56:31.391
Ironhide, move it.

1846
01:56:31.741 --> 01:56:33.693
Go!
Go, go!

1847
01:56:45.024 --> 01:56:46.495
There's no way to go.
We're gonna die!

1848
01:56:46.496 --> 01:56:48.878
Listen, we're going out.
We're going out like men, understand?

1849
01:57:18.548 --> 01:57:20.655
- Oh.
- Look at this motherf...

1850
01:57:21.246 --> 01:57:23.240
Mean robots suck!

1851
01:57:35.844 --> 01:57:37.113
Get back!

1852
01:57:41.642 --> 01:57:43.052
Grab it!
Don't let go.

1853
01:57:43.229 --> 01:57:44.675
Hang in, man,
I got this.

1854
01:57:49.653 --> 01:57:51.331
I don't wanna die.

1855
01:57:53.077 --> 01:57:55.021
Careful grip, boy.
Careful grip.

1856
01:58:00.685 --> 01:58:03.208
He did.
He got so waste.

1857
01:58:03.551 --> 01:58:04.792
Who's your daddy
now, huh?

1858
01:58:04.793 --> 01:58:06.390
He got all these...

1859
01:58:06.391 --> 01:58:08.218
Well, the safe place
is right under it.

1860
01:58:08.506 --> 01:58:10.821
Run it.
Run for his feet!

1861
01:58:19.307 --> 01:58:22.698
You're never eating me.
I'm gonna bust your face up.

1862
01:58:31.315 --> 01:58:33.686
Nobody's tested me.
In your face!

1863
01:58:34.875 --> 01:58:36.521
Take five, Mudflap.

1864
01:58:37.335 --> 01:58:38.772
Oh my God!

1865
01:58:41.621 --> 01:58:43.470
Yeehaw!

1866
01:58:45.189 --> 01:58:47.038
Nobody messes
with the twins.

1867
01:58:50.060 --> 01:58:51.570
I got you.

1868
01:58:54.658 --> 01:58:56.987
Ow, man,
you shot me in the face!

1869
01:58:57.431 --> 01:58:59.688
- Stay under it!
- Yeah, stay under it.

1870
01:59:09.533 --> 01:59:11.357
Rampage, set up the trap.

1871
01:59:21.094 --> 01:59:22.081
Judy!

1872
01:59:27.322 --> 01:59:28.925
- Sam!
- What?

1873
01:59:28.960 --> 01:59:30.235
Sam!

1874
01:59:30.495 --> 01:59:32.068
Sam! Sam!

1875
01:59:36.762 --> 01:59:38.285
Sam!

1876
01:59:38.296 --> 01:59:39.693
- Sam.
- Dad!

1877
01:59:47.247 --> 01:59:48.764
Wait! Wait!

1878
01:59:50.087 --> 01:59:51.337
Please listen...

1879
01:59:52.024 --> 01:59:53.646
I want you to run!
Run!

1880
01:59:53.686 --> 01:59:54.685
- Dad, just stop!
- Get out of here.

1881
01:59:54.686 --> 01:59:56.222
- They don't want you, they want me.
- Just run!

1882
01:59:56.223 --> 01:59:57.643
Oh God, wait!

1883
01:59:57.728 --> 02:00:00.491
- Samuel Witwicky.
- Wait.

1884
02:00:02.460 --> 02:00:03.772
This is what you want.
You don't want 'em.

1885
02:00:04.225 --> 02:00:06.231
- Go! Go!
- Please, stop! Stop!

1886
02:00:06.232 --> 02:00:08.183
- Why don't you...
- Just get out of here!

1887
02:00:09.310 --> 02:00:10.706
Just don't move.

1888
02:00:10.766 --> 02:00:11.636
I know you.

1889
02:00:11.637 --> 02:00:13.336
Just go!
Just go!

1890
02:00:13.371 --> 02:00:14.793
And I know what,
you need me.

1891
02:00:15.739 --> 02:00:17.347
Because I know about
the Matrix.

1892
02:00:17.689 --> 02:00:19.295
- Don't do it. Sam, listen to me.
- Please, Dad.

1893
02:00:19.334 --> 02:00:20.326
They're gonna
kill us all anyway.

1894
02:00:20.327 --> 02:00:21.778
Hey, hey.
Look.

1895
02:00:21.779 --> 02:00:23.131
This is what you want.
I'm here.

1896
02:00:23.847 --> 02:00:25.572
Bumblebee!

1897
02:00:29.179 --> 02:00:30.428
Help!

1898
02:00:37.950 --> 02:00:39.874
Kill him, Bee.
Kill him.

1899
02:01:19.168 --> 02:01:20.884
Come on,
get in.

1900
02:01:34.568 --> 02:01:36.498
- Bee?
- Yeah.

1901
02:01:39.714 --> 02:01:42.903
Hey! I don't know what's going on,
but we gotta move.

1902
02:01:46.534 --> 02:01:48.263
- Run!
- There's gotta be a way out of here.

1903
02:01:53.641 --> 02:01:55.559
Buckle up, buckle up!
Get in here.

1904
02:01:57.809 --> 02:01:59.960
Bee! Bumblebee!

1905
02:02:00.675 --> 02:02:02.533
You get them
somewhere safe, alright?

1906
02:02:04.990 --> 02:02:06.325
You gotta get in the car.
You can be safe.

1907
02:02:06.365 --> 02:02:08.187
No, listen to my discussion.

1908
02:02:08.222 --> 02:02:09.611
- You're my son, alright?
- I know!

1909
02:02:09.612 --> 02:02:11.537
You're my son!
We'll all go together.

1910
02:02:11.577 --> 02:02:13.013
- Listen.
- We're all going together.

1911
02:02:13.048 --> 02:02:15.137
Dad, stop, okay?
Get in the car.

1912
02:02:15.172 --> 02:02:17.203
He's gonna get you to safety.
You don't, you run.

1913
02:02:17.239 --> 02:02:19.455
You don't stop, you don't hide, you run.
You hear what I'm saying?

1914
02:02:19.698 --> 02:02:21.326
Okay?
I'll find you when you're safe.

1915
02:02:21.361 --> 02:02:22.823
- No.
- You gotta let me go, Dad.

1916
02:02:22.858 --> 02:02:24.217
You'll have
to let me go.

1917
02:02:24.850 --> 02:02:26.351
- You have to.
- Ron.

1918
02:02:28.863 --> 02:02:31.457
Ron, Ron!
Let him go.

1919
02:02:33.350 --> 02:02:34.992
Just come back!

1920
02:02:35.208 --> 02:02:36.518
- Come on!
- Come on!

1921
02:02:36.519 --> 02:02:37.696
Mikaela, Mikaela!

1922
02:02:37.697 --> 02:02:39.466
- Go with my parents.
- I'm not gonna go with them.

1923
02:02:57.545 --> 02:03:00.284
- We got Jordanians!
- We got help!

1924
02:03:24.411 --> 02:03:25.866
You okay, soldier?

1925
02:03:26.044 --> 02:03:27.424
We're gonna help you,
soldier.

1926
02:03:27.705 --> 02:03:29.513
Let's get being moon
and clear the birds!

1927
02:03:29.548 --> 02:03:31.062
Stay still, stay still.
Don't move.

1928
02:03:31.665 --> 02:03:32.904
You alright, young man?

1929
02:03:32.905 --> 02:03:34.532
- You have a radio?
- Yes.

1930
02:03:35.378 --> 02:03:37.541
Hey kid,
it's been nice knowing you.

1931
02:03:37.723 --> 02:03:39.614
Remember what I did
for my country.

1932
02:03:41.051 --> 02:03:42.531
This is my moment.

1933
02:03:43.732 --> 02:03:45.469
You're crazy!

1934
02:03:46.945 --> 02:03:48.791
ETA to station,
two minutes.

1935
02:03:48.826 --> 02:03:50.687
- Put it on the main screen.
- Sir, yes, sir.

1936
02:03:50.943 --> 02:03:52.475
Predator's air-one.

1937
02:04:02.400 --> 02:04:03.899
Oh shit, it's a trick.

1938
02:04:03.950 --> 02:04:06.401
Commence Operation Firestorm.
Send everyone.

1939
02:04:06.436 --> 02:04:09.262
- Get those boys out of the ground.
- This is 101 in strike packages.

1940
02:04:09.331 --> 02:04:10.943
Fast course river.
Execute lightly.

1941
02:04:31.269 --> 02:04:33.378
- Spotted Sam.
- Hurry, don't slow up!

1942
02:04:34.417 --> 02:04:36.163
Ironhide!

1943
02:04:36.430 --> 02:04:38.626
Follow us to the pillars.
We'll take you to Optimus.

1944
02:04:38.762 --> 02:04:39.746
Look out!

1945
02:04:42.467 --> 02:04:44.550
Sam, get to the pillars!

1946
02:04:45.825 --> 02:04:47.050
Let's go.

1947
02:04:50.501 --> 02:04:53.937
Oh God, this is it. The pyramids built
right over the machine.

1948
02:04:53.973 --> 02:04:55.443
They turn
that machine on...

1949
02:04:57.141 --> 02:04:58.687
no more Sun.

1950
02:05:00.819 --> 02:05:02.213
Not on my watch.

1951
02:05:02.341 --> 02:05:05.382
Not on my watch.

1952
02:05:16.191 --> 02:05:19.119
<i>- USS Stennis, identify.
- Hey, where the hell are you?</i>

1953
02:05:19.307 --> 02:05:20.180
<i>What, you're on
a weather channel?</i>

1954
02:05:20.181 --> 02:05:22.243
<i>Sports center,
high-dreaming TV or something?</i>

1955
02:05:22.273 --> 02:05:23.954
We get a pretty hundred
satellites up there.

1956
02:05:24.044 --> 02:05:26.437
Where the hell
are all our men?

1957
02:05:26.646 --> 02:05:28.216
Identify yourself.

1958
02:05:28.476 --> 02:05:29.813
What is your name, sailor?

1959
02:05:30.258 --> 02:05:35.423
Wilder, Captain of the
USS John C. Stennis Aircraft Carrier.

1960
02:05:36.549 --> 02:05:38.072
Okay, Captain Wilder,

1961
02:05:38.107 --> 02:05:40.606
<i>this is Agent Seymour Simmons,
head of the Sector Seven.</i>

1962
02:05:40.717 --> 02:05:43.091
<i>There is a mother of
all non-biologicals</i>

1963
02:05:43.126 --> 02:05:44.920
<i>getting ready
to blow up our Sun.</i>

1964
02:05:45.213 --> 02:05:46.810
You want to have fooled down
about my lack of clearance,

1965
02:05:46.845 --> 02:05:49.090
or you want to help
save a gazillion lives?

1966
02:05:49.725 --> 02:05:52.109
Alright, Agent Simmons.
I'm listening.

1967
02:05:59.321 --> 02:06:00.658
Five klicks.

1968
02:06:00.957 --> 02:06:02.112
<i>West of the gulf.</i>

1969
02:06:02.113 --> 02:06:05.049
<i>We got ourselves a dalion
remodelling a pyramid.</i>

1970
02:06:05.532 --> 02:06:08.537
I want hopes of prototype weapon
pull a rail gun.

1971
02:06:09.900 --> 02:06:11.430
That's classified.

1972
02:06:11.431 --> 02:06:15.299
Don't talk to me
about classified, alright?

1973
02:06:15.334 --> 02:06:17.070
Now if you've got
a battleship in the gulf

1974
02:06:17.984 --> 02:06:20.871
you tell him to ready
that weapon!

1975
02:06:21.884 --> 02:06:24.306
Contact Destroyer,
USS Kit.

1976
02:06:26.647 --> 02:06:28.380
This way!
Move it!

1977
02:06:30.352 --> 02:06:32.121
What you need is there.

1978
02:06:32.594 --> 02:06:34.286
Let's go! Go!

1979
02:06:38.107 --> 02:06:39.631
Give me your talk.
Come on.

1980
02:06:39.666 --> 02:06:40.817
Epps!

1981
02:06:45.209 --> 02:06:46.999
Right now,
we need air support.

1982
02:06:47.694 --> 02:06:49.429
That ship's in contact.
20 miles...

1983
02:06:49.430 --> 02:06:51.600
Grid on contact.
Proceed 88, Alpha Sierra.

1984
02:06:55.583 --> 02:06:58.670
USS Stenin 0-9-0,
you are approved to drop a 2,000...

1985
02:07:06.853 --> 02:07:08.136
- What you got?
- A detonator, sir.

1986
02:07:08.137 --> 02:07:10.174
They're 600 minutes away and
they're heading right for the pillars.

1987
02:07:10.209 --> 02:07:11.379
Alright.

1988
02:07:11.620 --> 02:07:13.019
Precious cargo's coming.

1989
02:07:13.299 --> 02:07:14.605
Move!

1990
02:07:40.691 --> 02:07:41.872
Sam!

1991
02:07:41.873 --> 02:07:43.540
Spotted Sam.

1992
02:08:14.801 --> 02:08:16.041
Come on!

1993
02:08:16.042 --> 02:08:18.555
2-2, covering fire.
Two civilians, twelve o'clock.

1994
02:08:26.847 --> 02:08:28.344
Cover for us.

1995
02:08:34.875 --> 02:08:37.855
Okay, air strike.
We'll rescue the civilians.

1996
02:08:57.401 --> 02:08:59.270
Come on. Get up!

1997
02:08:59.704 --> 02:09:00.688
Come on!

1998
02:09:01.494 --> 02:09:02.687
Get in here.

1999
02:09:03.011 --> 02:09:04.453
Oh look
who showed up.

2000
02:09:04.454 --> 02:09:06.549
You better have a good reason
for us to be here.

2001
02:09:06.580 --> 02:09:07.702
Where's Optimus?

2002
02:09:07.703 --> 02:09:09.543
He's right over there,
across the courtyard.

2003
02:09:10.659 --> 02:09:11.574
I got to get to him
right now.

2004
02:09:11.575 --> 02:09:12.995
No, we got
an air strike coming.

2005
02:09:12.996 --> 02:09:14.474
I have to get to him
right now.

2006
02:09:16.559 --> 02:09:18.027
Come here,
b-back.

2007
02:09:28.080 --> 02:09:29.659
Incoming!

2008
02:09:33.647 --> 02:09:36.595
Behold to the only
Jetfire!

2009
02:09:37.789 --> 02:09:41.452
Now let me show you
how we brought them pain in my day.

2010
02:10:01.447 --> 02:10:02.833
Too old
for this crap.

2011
02:10:02.868 --> 02:10:03.888
Keep going.

2012
02:10:03.889 --> 02:10:05.242
15 minutes of fighting.

2013
02:10:25.404 --> 02:10:29.221
I am directly below
the enemy's scrotum.

2014
02:10:29.976 --> 02:10:32.186
<i>25.7 metres
above sea level,</i>

2015
02:10:32.238 --> 02:10:33.412
<i>29.32 North.</i>

2016
02:10:33.413 --> 02:10:35.600
- Field track, 5-2, 0500 o'clock.
- Target acquired.

2017
02:10:35.671 --> 02:10:36.974
Killing track two.

2018
02:10:36.975 --> 02:10:38.799
<i>Lock. Fire.</i>

2019
02:10:53.807 --> 02:10:55.771
Yeah! Yeah!

2020
02:10:55.805 --> 02:10:57.739
<i>B-1, stand on my target.
30 seconds...</i>

2021
02:10:59.530 --> 02:11:01.712
We're gonna make a break
for the beast on my command, okay?

2022
02:11:01.763 --> 02:11:03.636
You guys stick with me,
you understand?

2023
02:11:03.671 --> 02:11:05.446
You stay on my ass.

2024
02:11:06.533 --> 02:11:08.392
Hope these F-16s
got good aim.

2025
02:11:08.393 --> 02:11:09.716
Yeah, why is that?

2026
02:11:09.717 --> 02:11:11.349
I told them
to hit the orange smoke.

2027
02:11:13.182 --> 02:11:14.824
You mean
that orange smoke?

2028
02:11:14.825 --> 02:11:16.595
It wasn't my best toss,
okay?

2029
02:11:18.300 --> 02:11:19.831
- Run!
- Run!

2030
02:11:28.311 --> 02:11:29.839
Incoming!

2031
02:11:32.970 --> 02:11:34.066
Come on.

2032
02:12:07.657 --> 02:12:09.087
Die!

2033
02:12:15.568 --> 02:12:16.919
Sam!

2034
02:12:32.999 --> 02:12:34.817
Hold your fire!

2035
02:12:37.058 --> 02:12:38.181
Sam!

2036
02:12:39.762 --> 02:12:42.064
Get out!
Get me an EVAC.

2037
02:12:44.097 --> 02:12:46.247
Can't you do something?

2038
02:13:21.366 --> 02:13:23.431
- Sam! Sam...
- Sam!

2039
02:13:30.110 --> 02:13:32.628
Come on, we got to move.
We got to move! Come on!

2040
02:13:37.747 --> 02:13:39.202
Sammy!

2041
02:13:42.551 --> 02:13:45.992
Clear! Take a shot.
Clear! Take a shot.

2042
02:13:46.084 --> 02:13:47.742
One, two, three.

2043
02:13:50.364 --> 02:13:51.488
Do it again.

2044
02:13:56.808 --> 02:13:58.652
Sam!

2045
02:14:00.492 --> 02:14:05.639
Okay, listen to my voice.
I love you and I need you.

2046
02:14:06.474 --> 02:14:11.834
Please, please come back to me.
Sam, please! I love you!

2047
02:14:23.605 --> 02:14:25.430
Am I dead?

2048
02:14:26.222 --> 02:14:30.531
We have been watching you.
A long, long time.

2049
02:14:32.824 --> 02:14:34.879
You have fought
for Optimus,

2050
02:14:35.052 --> 02:14:39.542
our last descendant,
with courage and with sacrifice.

2051
02:14:39.577 --> 02:14:42.203
The virtues of a leader.

2052
02:14:42.659 --> 02:14:45.773
A leader
worthy of our secret.

2053
02:14:46.084 --> 02:14:48.980
The Matrix of Leadership
is not found.

2054
02:14:49.503 --> 02:14:50.921
It is earned.

2055
02:14:52.017 --> 02:14:54.299
Return now to Optimus,

2056
02:14:54.932 --> 02:14:57.174
merge the Matrix
with his Spark.

2057
02:14:57.867 --> 02:15:02.564
It is, and always has been,
your destiny.

2058
02:15:07.369 --> 02:15:08.855
Sam.

2059
02:15:14.709 --> 02:15:16.046
I love you.

2060
02:15:54.931 --> 02:15:57.840
Boy, you returned
for me.

2061
02:15:59.289 --> 02:16:01.304
A living Prime!

2062
02:16:02.832 --> 02:16:05.272
I don't believe it.

2063
02:16:15.456 --> 02:16:17.856
My Matrix.

2064
02:16:23.334 --> 02:16:24.635
Get up, get up,
get up, get up.

2065
02:16:25.854 --> 02:16:27.623
Get up, Prime!

2066
02:16:28.915 --> 02:16:32.418
- Oh, no.
- He's turned on the machine.

2067
02:16:33.224 --> 02:16:34.946
You gotta stop him.
Get up!

2068
02:16:35.267 --> 02:16:36.821
Optimus!

2069
02:16:38.905 --> 02:16:41.381
Fallen, my master.

2070
02:16:41.553 --> 02:16:45.885
My brothers could not
stop me from this.

2071
02:16:46.900 --> 02:16:51.453
- Yes.
- Now I claim your sun.

2072
02:16:54.317 --> 02:16:55.986
Enemy target,
top of pyramid.

2073
02:16:55.987 --> 02:16:58.140
Engage,
engage, engage.

2074
02:17:03.509 --> 02:17:06.430
In moments,
we'll be at siren strength.

2075
02:17:22.244 --> 02:17:26.699
I never did a thing
worth doing until now.

2076
02:17:27.382 --> 02:17:30.162
Optimus,
take my parts.

2077
02:17:30.373 --> 02:17:33.280
And you'll have a power
you've never known.

2078
02:17:34.197 --> 02:17:36.372
Fulfill your destiny.

2079
02:17:42.413 --> 02:17:44.668
Jolt, electrify!

2080
02:18:05.260 --> 02:18:06.911
Let's roll.

2081
02:18:09.375 --> 02:18:11.226
Fire. Take it off
to the pyramid!

2082
02:18:23.289 --> 02:18:26.933
This planet
will be dark forever.

2083
02:18:49.293 --> 02:18:51.537
Die
like your brother.

2084
02:18:52.142 --> 02:18:54.455
They were
your brothers too.

2085
02:19:23.098 --> 02:19:25.382
First gra...

2086
02:19:38.286 --> 02:19:40.347
You picked
the wrong planet!

2087
02:19:43.287 --> 02:19:45.282
Give me your face.

2088
02:19:53.756 --> 02:19:57.889
I rise.
You fall.

2089
02:19:59.988 --> 02:20:03.183
No. No.

2090
02:20:04.670 --> 02:20:09.416
Not to call you a coward, Master,
but sometimes,

2091
02:20:09.417 --> 02:20:13.138
cowards do survive.

2092
02:20:13.670 --> 02:20:15.607
This isn't over.

2093
02:20:43.068 --> 02:20:45.895
You took all of this for you
to tell me that you love me.

2094
02:20:47.615 --> 02:20:49.086
You said it first.

2095
02:21:40.526 --> 02:21:42.943
Thank you, Sam,
for saving my life.

2096
02:21:44.402 --> 02:21:45.454
You're welcome.

2097
02:21:46.432 --> 02:21:48.166
Thank you
for believing in me.

2098
02:21:52.889 --> 02:21:57.535
<i>Our races united by a history
long forgotten.</i>

2099
02:21:57.536 --> 02:22:00.842
<i>And a future
we shall face together.</i>

2100
02:22:01.566 --> 02:22:05.828
<i>I am Optimus Prime,
and I send this message</i>

2101
02:22:05.862 --> 02:22:09.104
<i>so that our past
will always be remembered.</i>

2102
02:22:09.105 --> 02:22:13.018
<i>For in those memories,
we live on.</i>
